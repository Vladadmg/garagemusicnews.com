		<description><![CDATA[by Jordan Narloch On March 11, Motion City Soundtrack announced they were calling it quits after one last tour. It only seems fitting to compile Motion City Soundtrack’s greatest hits for our latest series. Rather than going strictly on popularity, I chose songs that I felt captured the idea of the band. Songs that held clever lyrics, expanding your vocabulary and making you emotional as you dared to sing along with Justin Pierre’s unique melodies. Songs that grappled you with trademark Jesse Johnson Moog synthesizer hooks or that caught your ear with interweaving guitar parts courtesy of Josh Cain. Songs backed by irregular drumbeats, forcing you to pay attention to Tony Thaxton (Claudio Rivera on Panic Stations). Songs where Matthew Taylor’s voice accentuated Pierre’s to perfection, while he simultaneously delivered memorable bass lines. The band’s musical skill and impact on me is too great to capture in a short introduction. I only hope you can enjoy this playlist and begin to see the greatness that is Motion City Soundtrack. &#8220;The Future Freaks Me Out&#8221; &#8220;My Favorite Accident&#8221; &#8220;Everything Is Alright&#8221; &#8220;When You’re Around&#8221; &#8220;Lg Fuad&#8221; &#8220;Fell In Love Without You&#8221; &#8220;Broken Heart&#8221; &#8220;Even If It Kills Me&#8221; &#8220;Her Words Destroyed [...]<img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=8106&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>

But unlike most of my other childhood favorites&#8211;who I left with my pink lip gloss and denim skorts back in 2007&#8211;my love for Matt Nathanson is currently stronger than ever. Part of why I still love his music so much is that although he was one of the prime representatives of the sad, sappy love ballads that plagued the mid-2000s, his sound has evolved with time into upbeat, summery acoustic rock, and I can’t get enough. I’ll admit I have a Spotify playlist titled “Happy,” and his last three albums make up about 40% of it. So, that being said, here are Matt Nathanson’s greatest hits, according to someone who wasn’t even alive for the release of his first three albums.

The music video is quite the trip, too.

<p><em>by <a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/sarahbel">Sarah Bel Kloetzke</a></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I figured that if I was making a greatest hits list, I might as well make it of a band that (sadly) doesn’t exist anymore. The Academy Is… are a Chicago-based pop rock band that were active from 2003-2011, before their temporary reunion in 2015. I approached this list at a few different angles, but eventually just chose the songs that I personally believe are best. There are a few tracks that truly were their biggest hits, like “Slow Down,” “Phrase That Pays,” “We’ve Got A Big Mess On Our Hands,” and “About A Girl”- all of which are singles. “Big Mess” is actually my absolute favorite TAI song, so if you’re not familiar with this band, definitely check that song out. The music video is quite the trip, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I also chose some of their more discreet songs. “40 Steps” and “Every Burden Has A Version” are both b-sides, and the line “unkempt and over-caffeinated” from “40 Steps”</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">has been in all of my social media bios for some time now. “Every Burden”</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">is a song that I identify with and it really means a lot to me, much like “Down and Out”</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">and “After The Last Midtown Show”&#8211;more songs that I couldn’t stop myself from putting on the list. Not many people know about the EPs that The Academy Is… released, but there are some real gems on those, like “The Fever”</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">and “New York (Saint In The City).”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I’m a big fan of TAI’s punkier songs, like “LAX to O’Hare,” “Crowded Room,” “Chop Chop,” and “Black Mamba.” “Black Mamba” has a line in it&#8211;“Oh Mr. Magazine, never wrote one single thing for you and your so-called music scene”&#8211;that I find entertaining for obvious reasons. Also, I think my favorite bridge ever is the piano break in “Chop Chop</span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The Academy Is… consistently put out great music in their time and were a crucial part of the late 2000s pop-punk scene. I’ll probably always rank them as one of my all-time favorite bands.</span></p>

<p>When it comes to TBT playlists, one would expect a cluster of songs that are generally embarrassing. However, the only thing that I might find embarrassing is that all my favorite middle school bands were borderline boy bands. Yes All-American Rejects, I am talking about you. But truth be told, my taste hasn’t changed an awful lot so I can’t say I’m too ashamed. Fortunately, I was able to dive into the good old poppy emo-rock I listen to today pretty early on in life. This with a combination of classic rock and 90s jams introduced to me by my father largely comprised my music catalog right around the 6<sup>th</sup>/7<sup>th</sup> grade era. Enjoy diving into the iPod of little, adolescent Jordan.</p>

<ol>
<li><em>All American Rejects</em> – Dirty Little Secret</li>
</ol>
<p>What throwback playlist from a young adult my age wouldn’t be complete without a little Rejects?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><em>Fall Out Boy </em>– Sugar We’re Going Down</li>
</ol>
<p>Going hand-in-hand with AAR, I fell in love with everyone’s favorite emo rockers thanks to this radio hit.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><em>The Fray </em>– You Found Me</li>
</ol>
<p>Trying to appeal to a more sophisticated “I’m going to listen to piano driven pop tunes” outlook, I found solace in The Fray.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><em>Paramore </em>– Pressure</li>
</ol>
<p>Middle school hit and I found out women could rock. Not a time goes by where I hear this song and don’t have flashbacks to strolling into 7<sup>th</sup> grade English refusing to let anyone disturb my jam session.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><em>Red Hot Chili Peppers </em>– Dani California</li>
</ol>
<p>In 6<sup>th</sup> grade all I wanted to do was listen to the Chili Peppers. In spite of my parents’ disapproval, I borrowed my friend’s copy of Stadium Arcadium and listened to it religiously. Dani California still remains my favorite off the record.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><em>Dave Matthews Band </em>– Ants Marching</li>
</ol>
<p>When I received my first iPod, I only had my dad’s CDs at my disposal to burn to iTunes. Memories of earlier childhood made this one of the most played songs on the prized little device.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><em>The Who </em>– Pinball Wizard</li>
</ol>
<p>Another influence passed down the generations, I remember latching on to The Who despite the fact that it resembled none of the other bands I enjoyed. Still Classic.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><em>Pearl Jam </em>– Daughter</li>
</ol>
<p>A family friend lent me Pearl Jam’s discography in 8<sup>th</sup> grade… what more is there to say?</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><em>The Killers </em>– Mr. Brightside</li>
</ol>
<p>A former snowboarding buddy of mine was obsessed with The Killers. Not a ride to the slopes went by where I wasn’t forced to listen to <em>Hot Fuss </em>and I couldn’t have been more fortunate that this was the case.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li><em>Matchbox Twenty </em>– 3 AM</li>
</ol>
<p>Matchbox Twenty’s greatest hits for Christmas one year was a gamechanger.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/6008/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/6008/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=6008&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[by Hana Simons We all listened to music when we were younger that we may or may not regret. But the greatest part about listening to music you used to love, is that it takes you back to those days.

<div class="embed-spotify"><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:garagemusicnews:playlist:2qLMU5l18WvfzxeIeAP4We" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></div>
<p><b>“Dear Insanity” &#8212; By Asking Alexandria</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Let&#8217;s be real. Who from my &#8220;generation&#8221; didn&#8217;t listen to Asking Alexandria?</span></p>
<p><b>“Screaming Bloody Murder” &#8212; Sum 41</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This is probably one of my favorite songs of all time.</span></p>
<p><b>“Rock n&#8217; Roll” &#8212; Eatmewhileimhot!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Yes, that is Christofer Drew, from Never Shout Never, on vocals. This was one of his side projects but, they go by &#8220;Eat Me Raw&#8221; now.</span></p>
<p><b>“Thnks Fr Th Mmrs” &#8212; Fall Out Boy</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I&#8217;m pretty sure everyone has listened to this song at one point in their lives.</span></p>
<p><b>“Life At Sea” &#8212; backpackparty</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This song made me feel happy when I was down and it still does. It&#8217;s nothing like what I used to listen to or currently enjoy. This is a super fun and light and lively song.</span></p>
<p><b>“Stick Stickly” &#8212; Attack Attack</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The day I heard this song was the day I fell in love with Austin Carlile&#8217;s voice. A few years went by and a new band started getting big and I think they&#8217;re called Of Mice &amp; Men? As you may have guessed I fell for Of Mice &amp; Men and they&#8217;re still one of my favorite bands. Stick Stickly started it all for me.</span></p>
<p><b>“Iodine” &#8212; Icon for Hire</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This was one of the first songs that I ever listened that talked about mental illnesses bluntly. I connected to this on a whole new level.</span></p>
<p><b>“Cassie” &#8212; Flyleaf</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I was really getting into women in rock at this point of my life. Flyleaf opened my eyes to women who could do heavy vocals.</span></p>
<p><b>“Damage” &#8212; Fit for Rivals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I discovered this band on YouTube and really enjoyed it.</span></p>
<p><b>“You Know That Ain&#8217;t Them Dogs&#8217; Real Voices” &#8212; I Wrestled A Bear Once</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This song changed everything for me. This was the first band to introduce me to female heavy vocalists who could scream for more than a few seconds.</span></p>
<p><b>“Dearest (I&#8217;m so sorry)” &#8212; Picture Me Broken</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I feel like I&#8217;m the only person who has even heard of this band. Truthfully, this was during my short lived scene phase. Watch the music video and you&#8217;ll see why. But I have to admit she can lay some nice screams out.</span></p>
<p><b>“Playing God” &#8212; Paramore</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Paramore will always be a huge part of my life. I’ve been waiting for about 6 years to see them.</span></p>
<p><b>“Eyes on Fire” &#8212; Blue Foundation</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Every Twilight fan will understand why this song is the best.</span></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/5896/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/5896/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=5896&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[by Lizzie It’s a universally known fact that middle school is basically the worst idea anyone ever had.

		<description><![CDATA[by Polina Pekurovsky Indie-folk is a genre that, honestly, I have been trying to stop listening to. Everytime I do, I get flooded with unwanted emotions of nostalgia and better days. Maybe it’s the soft guitar or the whispery voices that go with it, or the music video of people in flannels smiling in the misty Pacific Northwest forests. Whatever it is, it keeps drawing me back. I consider myself a well-rounded person (for the most part), and try to listen to a variety of genres. I enjoy most of them, but folk is the one that really hits me. A few notes of a song by Bon Iver and I’m already crying. It takes me back to lazy days in the Pacific Northwest: drinking coffee, laying in the pines and gazing up at mountains. I am thankful for that. This is the only genre that is capable of triggering such fond memories, and I cherish the flannel-wearing musicians of the Pacific Northwest for allowing me to go back to my memories for a small amount of time.<img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=5821&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
