<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I have a lot of bad habits. I wake up every morning with just enough time to get dressed and brush my teeth before I have to leave. I do math in pen knowing full well I&#8217;ll mess something up. I tie my shoes too tight. I impulse buy merch from openers I hadn&#8217;t heard of ten minutes ago. You know, regular stuff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I also open lots of tabs at once and promptly forget to look at them for months, only sending them to myself when my laptop needs to shut down and update with the full intention of looking at them later. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">There are emails still sitting in my disorganized inbox from 2012 that consist of eighty Wikipedia pages, dead Tumblr links, photos I wanted to download for some reason, and a considerable amount of long gone Etsy pages.</span></p>

<p><b>Track:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> “</span><a href="https://hussalonia.bandcamp.com/track/never-be-famous"><span style="font-weight:400;">Never Be Famous</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">” (Jul. 2007)</span></p>
<p><b>Artist:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Hussalonia</span></p>
<p><b>Tags:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> alternative, experimental pop, lo-fi</span></p>
<p><b>Favorite Lyric:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> &#8220;But they&#8217;re not brilliant, they&#8217;re just burning brilliantly. / There&#8217;s a difference, don&#8217;t you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If you know me, you know how much I love </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Welcome to Night Vale</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">. It&#8217;s pretty much the best podcast ever. It&#8217;s the radio show of a fictional town where sentient patches of haze do the ad buys and mountains are a myth, what more could you want? One of the best things about </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Night Vale</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, though, is the weather, which is nothing more than a song, originally sent in by listeners. That&#8217;s where I heard this song, in episode thirty-one, &#8220;</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STDGqgsPhJc"><span style="font-weight:400;">A Blinking Light Up On the Mountain</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">,&#8221; back in 2013.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Hussalonia is a little Night Valeian itself. Less of a band than a shifting conglomerate of whoever wants in, the Hussalonia founder (as he is only referred to as) calls it a &#8220;pop music cult,&#8221; and, in case that wasn&#8217;t enough to get you, the music &#8220;art-pop in the spirit of ‘60s beat and record-store-clerk-indie-post-punk-singer-songwriter-whatever-ness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The song is as fantastic as the artist. I actually can&#8217;t play &#8220;Never Be Famous&#8221; on Bandcamp anymore, I&#8217;ve listened to it too many times. Eventually you get to the point where they ask you to &#8220;open thy heart/wallet&#8221; and in all honestly, I probably will. Every Hussalonia song is short on purpose, to give you those precious moments of thrill before it ends and you&#8217;re left with &#8220;what </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">was</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> that?&#8221; This song&#8217;s driving beat does nothing to lengthen those two minutes and I just kept hitting play over and over.</span></p>

<p><b>Track:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> “</span><a href="https://carterhulsey.bandcamp.com/track/everything-falls-apart"><span style="font-weight:400;">Everything Falls Apart</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">” (May 2011)</span></p>
<p><b>Artist:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Carter Hulsey</span></p>
<p><b><i>Tags:</i></b><span style="font-weight:400;"> acoustic, singer-songwriter</span></p>
<p><b>Favorite Lyric:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> &#8220;Wondering how they stole the ink / From all our favorite pens&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I saw Carter Hulsey </span><a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/2015/11/24/live-at-the-garage-1121-the-millenium-more/"><span style="font-weight:400;">last November at THE GARAGE</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> with The Millenium, Whosah, and about eighty other bands. Especially among his pop punk peers, Hulsey really stood out to me as more Mumford &amp; Sons than Modern Baseball. After he played his beautiful and funny &#8220;NPR,&#8221; I looked up the rest of his music on my phone in the middle of his set (I know, shame on me) and saved this link.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This is one of his earlier songs, one that I don&#8217;t remember hearing, but it&#8217;s very much indicative of his later work as well. It&#8217;s a little sad, a little nostalgic, a little hopeful, and very much beautiful.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Track:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> “</span><a href="https://tomrosenthal.bandcamp.com/track/karl-marx-in-the-bath"><span style="font-weight:400;">Karl Marx in the Bath</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">” (Oct. 2011)</span></p>
<p><b>Artist:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Tom Rosenthal</span></p>
<p><b>Tags:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> alternative, folk</span></p>
<p><b>Favorite Lyric:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> &#8220;You, you used to read Karl Marx, alone in the bath, whenever / You were low, whenever you were low.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I love YouTube and I love film and I love YouTube film, especially when there&#8217;s Tom Rosenthal soundtracks. I also love Tom Rosenthal. I need you to know this so you understand firstly, that I am incredibly biased when it comes to this song, and secondly, why I&#8217;m biased in the first place. I first heard him in Bertie Gilbert&#8217;s </span><a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PtUUvQtChNc"><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Rocks That Bleed</span></i></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, a brilliant film that Rosenthal did a Beatles cover for, and even on first listen there was something so compellingly familiar about his voice that I had to look him up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Despite his music only getting better over the years, this song off his first album remains one of my favorites. There&#8217;s something odd about it. At first glancing listen, it&#8217;s a nice little tune with whistling reminiscent of a Simon &amp; Garfunkel song your parents used to play when you were little. Upon reading the lyrics, it&#8217;s a little too absurd to be real, a little too sad to be made up, and a little too specific to wholly one or the other, and that&#8217;s exactly what makes it so good. It feels like a dream you once had, or someone once told you, or maybe never happened at all.</span></p>

<p><b>Track:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> “</span><a href="http://mattolsson.bandcamp.com/track/snakes-langley-3"><span style="font-weight:400;">Snakes (Langley)</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">” (Oct. 2012)</span></p>
<p><b>Artist:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Matt Olsson</span></p>
<p><b><i>Tags:</i></b><span style="font-weight:400;"> americana, folk rock, singer-songwriter</span></p>
<p><b>Favorite Lyric:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> &#8220;I know the secret. I know it all. / And I am better for it. I am better by the pound.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>When I find myself in hardcore procrastination mode, I like to watch the live feed of albums being sold on Bandcamp and click on whatever look interesting; a Russian Roulette of independent artists, if you will. I am 80% sure that&#8217;s where this came from.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Now, you know an album&#8217;s going to be good when there&#8217;s credit for a jug player, although it sadly isn&#8217;t for this particular song. This is a concept album about an American spy during the Cold War and, as interesting as that is, it&#8217;s a pretty good song in and of itself. It feels like when winter is finally over and you find you&#8217;ve forgotten what warm felt like but the snow is finally all gone and you know you won&#8217;t have to worry about it for a long while.</span></p>

<p><b>Track:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> “</span><a href="https://televisionsss.bandcamp.com/track/new-flesh"><span style="font-weight:400;">New Flesh</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">” (Jan. 2013)</span></p>
<p><b>Artist:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> TELE/VISIONS</span></p>
<p><b>Tags:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> bedroom pop, dance, indie, lo-fi</span></p>
<p><b>Favorite Lyric:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> &#8220;I watched Videodrome and lost my mind&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I definitely don&#8217;t know where this is from, but this song is a bop. A possibly more accurate genre would be bedroom dance pop; this is the kind of song that plays in the opening montage of a John Hughes movie where the protagonist is deciding what to wear to school that day. TELE/VISIONS is now Current Joys, which sounds more like The Smiths, but thankfully the 80&#8217;s vibes carry on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Track:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> “</span><a href="http://pinegrove.bandcamp.com/track/-"><span style="font-weight:400;">&amp;</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">” (Jul. 2013)</span></p>
<p><b>Artist:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Pinegrove</span></p>
<p><b>Tags:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> alternative rock, electric-sad, language arts rock</span></p>
<p><b>Favorite Lyric:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> &#8220;Hand over hand / I’m pulling myself together / on this itchy couch again&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I love Bandcamp tags. They&#8217;re really weird. They let the artist describe the genre the way they really want instead of picking from an allotted list of generalization, so you get a lot of very interesting and specific stuff, like “language arts rock,” which I assume is a variation on “math rock,” and “electric-sad,” which I feel on a spiritual level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Language arts rock” is very fitting description as an evolution of “math rock” with more verbose lyrics. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen lyrics that more closely resemble an 18th century poem. I had to break out an honest to goodness dictionary for some of these (&#8220;mimetic&#8221; and &#8220;tessela&#8221; just to name a few) and that was truly an enjoyable experience. If you only read the lyrics, the ending looks like a bizarre cross between &#8220;</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6RbEOlqRo"><span style="font-weight:400;">Moonbase Alpha provides a realistic simulation of life on a natural satellite</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8221; and the ergodic and infamous </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Leaves"><i><span style="font-weight:400;">House of Leaves</span></i></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, an interesting combination if ever I saw one, but really the sound of multiple ampersands is some nice folk-y rock.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Track:</b> <a href="https://bldg5.bandcamp.com/track/move-on-2"><span style="font-weight:400;">Move On</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (Nov. 2013)</span></p>
<p><b>Artist:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Garden City Movement</span></p>
<p><b>Tags:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> electronic, chillwave</span></p>
<p><b>Favorite Lyric:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> &#8220;And the taste of bells / To the atmos-greet&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This came to me from some Buzzfeed-esque link dump of </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=651E4R9RjAs"><span style="font-weight:400;">music videos with LGBT couples</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. Garden City Movement is an electronic indie pop band from Tel Aviv and, if I had to guess, I would say this is the definition of chillwave. I don&#8217;t really get the -wave genres, but chill is definitely true; it&#8217;s a relaxing but sad kind of nostalgic. Especially with the composed visuals of the video, this song feels like someone else&#8217;s memory.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<iframe width='100%' height='120' style='position: relative; display: block; width: 100%; height: 120px;' src='//bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1650922514/album=779649841/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/' allowtransparency='true' frameborder='0'></iframe>
<p><b>Track:</b> <a href="https://adultmom.bandcamp.com/track/i-think-im-old-enough"><span style="font-weight:400;">I Think I&#8217;m Old Enough</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (Jul. 2014)</span></p>
<p><b>Artist:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Adult Mom</span></p>
<p><b>Tags:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> pop, bedroom</span></p>
<p><b>Favorite Lyric:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> &#8220;cuz it&#8217;s weird when your parents start actin&#8217; like your pals&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Adult Mom comes with the endorsement of our fearless editor Sararosa, who I trust more than almost anyone to give good music recommendations. What does Adult Mom mean? A mom who is an adult? A mom </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">for</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> adults? Who knows! And who cares, really, because the sound is goodness incarnate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This little song, in all its honesty and </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Friends</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> references, is understanding to the point that it gets a little too real. If you like Bad Bad Hats (which you should), you will definitely like this (which you also should).</span></p>

<p><b>Track:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> “</span><a href="https://michaelceramusic.bandcamp.com/track/2048"><span style="font-weight:400;">2048</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">” (Aug. 2014)</span></p>
<p><b>Artist:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Michael Cera</span></p>
<p><b>Tags:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> alternative, home recording, modest</span></p>
<p><b>Favorite Lyric:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> N/A</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Remember when Michael Cera released an album? I swear to God, I thought it was fake when I first saw it. Then I thought it was a joke. Then I actually listened to it and fell in love, and not just because I&#8217;ve always had a soft spot for the guy. Never had I thought everyone&#8217;s favorite weirdo Michael Cera would come out with a surprise album of sincerely </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">good music</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In all honesty, if you look up &#8220;odd duck&#8221; in the dictionary, there&#8217;s probably a picture of Michael Cera right there next to the words &#8220;one that is both out of place and endearing.&#8221; The album is just the same, with its haphazard electric-analog-ragtime folk and indie rock. While most of the songs are some variation of Elliott Smith-esque ballad bits, &#8220;2048&#8221; is nothing more than an electronic instrumental break. It&#8217;s better than it sounds, I swear it&#8217;s absolutely adorable. Also, I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s named after the app, which remains one of my favorite time killing pastimes.</span></p>

<p><b>Track:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> “</span><a href="http://owel.bandcamp.com/track/every-good-boy-does-fine"><span style="font-weight:400;">Every Good Boy Does Fine</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">” (Apr. 2015)</span></p>
<p><b>Artist:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Owel</span></p>
<p><b>Tags:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> ambient</span></p>
<p><b>Favorite Lyric:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> &#8220;I&#8217;m a rare dying breed, and I&#8217;ll make it if I&#8217;m patient.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Finding new music tip #1: Put your favorite YouTube gamer and voice actor on Twitter notifications and wait for them to tweet about their childhood best friend&#8217;s band. </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ah_michael/status/690620923188129793"><span style="font-weight:400;">It totally works</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Ambient is a bit misleading, as far as genres go, though. This is definitely more indie pop than anything else, with just a splash of non-Brit Britpop. Infectious and upbeat, what could&#8217;ve been a simple song is taken to the next level by the combination of the staccato electric guitar and sweeping violin. This is the kind of song you listen to ten times in a row because every time you get to the end, you can&#8217;t wait to hear the beginning again.</span></p>

<p><b>Track:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> “</span><a href="http://terriblerecords.bandcamp.com/track/seeds"><span style="font-weight:400;">Seeds</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">” (May 2015)</span></p>
<p><b>Artist:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Moses Sumney</span></p>
<p><b>Tags:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> singer-songwriter</span></p>
<p><b>Favorite Lyric:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> &#8220;Sickness can&#8217;t afford / What the hopeful sell&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Sadly, my journey to this has been lost to the sands of time. I&#8217;ll assume I saw it on Twitter; that&#8217;s as safe a bet as any.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very striking song, and very sad in a beautiful way which reminds me of Sufjan Stevens (always a plus) and I can only assume that the rest of Moses Sumney&#8217;s music is just as stunning. You can&#8217;t just pull this kind of sound out of a hat, it&#8217;s too well-crafted to be a one time thing. He&#8217;s now the third person I&#8217;ve followed on Soundcloud, and considering his only company is Keaton Henson and Lin-Manuel Miranda, both of whom I love eternally, that says a lot.</p>

<p><b>Track:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> “</span><a href="https://wishing.bandcamp.com/track/moss"><span style="font-weight:400;">moss</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">” (Oct. 2015)</span></p>
<p><b>Artist:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> wishing</span></p>
<p><b>Tags:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> experimental, nice</span></p>
<p><b>Favorite Lyric:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> &#8220;do you always live life / beyond no trespassing signs&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Music recommended by musicians is always the best. This one comes from the blog of Mitch Welling aka </span><a href="http://flatsound.tumblr.com"><span style="font-weight:400;">flatsound</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, an endearing niche of ephemeral poetry and embroidered lyric. I&#8217;ve always seen Mitch&#8217;s site as an old shoe box of things you&#8217;ve carried from house to house without ever stopping to think why, so, in keeping with that metaphor, I assumed this would be the equivalent of a mixtape from an old friend. In actuality, wishing is a side project of his (both the band and the concept, thought one can only guess at the later).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Wishing, and this song in particular, shows a side we don&#8217;t always see in flatsound songs. It&#8217;s almost as though his usual indie-filtered spoken word has been abducted by dreamy aliens. The trickling synth creates an atmosphere of singularity I highly recommend, the same feeling as watching old movies on a slightly corrupted VHS.</span></p>

<p><b>Artist:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> The Goon Sax</span></p>
<p><b>Tags:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> alternative</span></p>
<p><b>Favorite Lyric:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> &#8220;And if I had a boyfriend / I&#8217;d tell him I care&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This song was released on my birthday and someone on Tumblr sent me the link. It said both happy birthday and please if I could listen to this new song by their favorite artist. The last time someone sent me a song for almost no reason turned out to be one of my favorite songs, so I figured I should take a look. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I spent the first thirty seconds of listening to this trying to figure out who exactly they reminded me of before I realized my brain was thinking about it as a song by The Vaccines and the similarities are frankly astounding. I didn&#8217;t think it was possible, but I think they&#8217;re better at the Vaccines sound than the actual Vaccines. A very happy birthday indeed, five months later.</span></p>

<p><b>Track:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> “</span><a href="http://housewivesmn.bandcamp.com/track/bleach-2"><span style="font-weight:400;">Bleach</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">” (Dec. 2015)</span></p>
<p><b>Artist:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Housewives</span></p>
<p><b>Tags:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> alternative, indie rock</span></p>
<p><b>Favorite Lyric:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> &#8220;lay down on my new carpet, baby / tell me what you thought of me from the start&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Local bands put Kevin Bacon to shame; pretty much everybody knows everyone else. Housewives, for example, I kept hearing about pretty much everywhere I went. Our art director Hana, who knows the girls, mentioned them at a meeting a while ago when we were talking about local music. I recognized them on someone else&#8217;s recommended albums on Bandcamp a week or so later and put them on my to-do list. Then, a few weeks ago, I finally heard them on The Current when Sararosa was on their &#8220;</span><a href="http://blog.thecurrent.org/2016/03/ask-a-cool-person-17-year-old-writer-sararosa-davies/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Ask a Cool Person</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8221; segment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;Passive aggressive feminine indie punk&#8221; is both ideal and spot on. &#8220;Bleach&#8221; is both quietly resigned to regret and unperturbed. Undulating guitar strums are like you&#8217;ve been set out at sea, but honestly, it&#8217;s whatever, you know?</span></p>

<p><b>Artist:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Parenthetical Girls</span></p>
<p><b>Tags:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> indie pop</span></p>
<p><b>Favorite Lyric:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> &#8220;sweetheart you are what you are / aghast, a gash, an earmarked bell jar&#8221;</span></p>
<p>I know I heard about Parenthetical Girls from someone else at THE GARAGE but for the life of me, I can&#8217;t remember who. Every day is a lot of back and forth and name-dropping with no intent of selfish betterment-by-association. Whoever it was, thank you.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about any of their other songs, but this was like one of those &#8220;Wonderland was an allegory for a psychedelic drug trip.&#8221; It’s a theory that’s very good, kinda weird and synth-y, and maybe a little too much of a stretch for my tastes.</p>

<p><b>Track:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> “</span><a href="https://florist.bandcamp.com/track/only-a-prayer-nothing-more"><span style="font-weight:400;">Only A Prayer, Nothing More</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">” (Jan. 2016)</span></p>
<p><b>Artist:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Florist</span></p>
<p><b>Tags:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> diy, pop, folk</span></p>
<p><b>Favorite Lyric:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> &#8220;i don&#8217;t know what i know anymore. i know what i love and nothing more&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This is also probably from the feed of albums just sold. If someone specifically told me about them, please come forward so I can hug you in gratitude, because this is probably my new favorite band.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Even with the random distortion here and there, &#8220;Only A Prayer, Nothing More&#8221; is first and foremost relaxing. This song is perfect for lying on your bed in the middle of the afternoon after you&#8217;ve finished all your errands and have nowhere to be. If you&#8217;re like me and are still obsessing over the </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Juno</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> soundtrack, this sounds like a kinder version of the Moldy Peaches track. I could listen to these four minutes and forty seconds for four hours and feel content, if only Bandcamp would let me.</span></p>

<p><b>Artist:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Talons&#8217;</span></p>
<p><b>Tags:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> expérimental, post 9-11, post-folk</span></p>
<p><b>Favorite Lyric:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> &#8220;Your time has come now. / Your time is gone now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This song is really good. Let&#8217;s start with that, because there isn&#8217;t much of anything else. I seriously can&#8217;t find anything about this band or music anywhere else on the entire Internet. The website they have linked is pretty barren information wise, although some very specific Googling led me to </span><a href="http://www.barkandhiss.com/talons/"><span style="font-weight:400;">this</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> brief bio on the band or artist or whoever it is, and it&#8217;s got a lot of stuff like </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3-6uHQmMrY"><span style="font-weight:400;">this</span></a> <span style="font-weight:400;">on it, which is weird. I&#8217;m not entirely sure what happened when I was listening to this, but I liked it, and that&#8217;s all that matters.</span></p>

<p><b>Track:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> “</span><a href="http://mothersathens.bandcamp.com/track/too-small-for-eyes-2"><span style="font-weight:400;">Too Small For Eyes</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">” (Feb. 2016)</span></p>
<p><b>Artist:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Mothers</span></p>
<p><b><i>Tags:</i></b><span style="font-weight:400;"> rock</span></p>
<p><b>Favorite Lyric:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> &#8220;i think i&#8217;m at my best / when nothing&#8217;s needing me&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I&#8217;ll admit, I religiously check the NPR YouTube channel, I am </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">that</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> obsessed with Tiny Desk Concerts. They&#8217;re a great way to find new music, or hear songs you already know in a different way. That&#8217;s where I found this song. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Mothers&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLy8mwJWRU"><span style="font-weight:400;">Tiny Desk Concert</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> was absolutely beautiful, minimalist and hypnotic, and as soon as I saw the Bandcamp link someone had posted in the comments, I bookmarked about half their discography and proceeded to rewatch the video seven times in a row.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Reviews from their Bandcamp supporters say that most of their work is more percussive and dynamic, but the plucking guitars and overall softness of this sound is what makes it shine (although, in all honesty, I like the Tiny Desk version more). It reminds me of beachgrass, gulls, and green sea glass not unlike the vinyl in color. The lead singer&#8217;s voice is like a gentle breeze ruffling your hair to make you realize that you are alive.</span></p>

<p><em>by <a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/ryan">Ryan Johnson</a></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Deaf” and “music” are two words that are rarely seen in the same sentence. “Deaf musician” is something seen even less often. Of course, we all know the story of Beethoven going Deaf and continuing composing, but did you know some of his music may be as memorable as it is because he was Deaf? The way he felt the vibrations of his piano was different than how he heard them, leading him to compose very innovative and everlasting music.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But this is totally a rarity in our world today, right? Not quite. It’s not that Deaf musicians aren’t there, it&#8217;s that few look for them. It isn’t really shocking that Deaf musicians are an underappreciated bunch within the normal establishment of music, which is structured for a hearing world. As an American Sign Language (ASL) student, I was elated to discover that my love for both ASL and music has a crossover. While there is a variety of </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WkfI9GH_AI"><span style="font-weight:400;">rock bands</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLAQ0myEFgA"><span style="font-weight:400;">percussionists</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfqbbMeFQpM"><span style="font-weight:400;">singers</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> that are Deaf, my favorite artists to watch and listen to are Deaf rappers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Signmark (</span><span style="font-weight:400;">Marko Vuoriheimo)</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> is a Finnish rapper who creates his raps in International Sign Language, which is a sort of summary of various national sign languages that creates a way for the international communication for the Deaf. He chooses to not use his spoken voice, so his albums feature rapper Brandon Bauer who vocally performs his rapping. Signmark’s albums come out as CD/DVD combos, to allow easy access to his music for the hearing as well as the Deaf. Like many rappers, his songs feature a variety of life topics, but </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYwX45ZDe_4"><span style="font-weight:400;">“Our Life (Deaf Rap)”</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> focuses on discrimination he has faced being a Deaf individual, as well as touching on Deaf history. </span></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/cYwX45ZDe_4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Signmark has a unique perspective and his music carries a message that most will never learn. Many of his songs, like my favorite </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUtM8_DOVUI"><span style="font-weight:400;">“Smells Like Victory,”</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> don’t let on he is Deaf, but Deafness is a message in majority of the body of his work. Since being a Deaf musician is somewhat of a rarity these artists feature their Deaf experience quite strongly in their work, to bring awareness and education. So it was significant when Signmark became the first Deaf recording artist to become signed by an international recording label, Warner Music. That event wasn’t only exciting for Vuoriheimo, but was a milestone for Deaf musicians, as well as the Deaf community. There are various testaments to his impact on the Deaf community, </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/56142321"><span style="font-weight:400;">from grateful students inspired by his success to politicians who say his music is changing the way the world interprets Deafness</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Signmark fortunately isn’t the only Deaf rapper on my playlists. Sean Forbes is a Deaf rapper a little closer to home, based out of Michigan. Forbes raps in ASL, but performs his pieces verbally as well. His 2012 album </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Perfect Imperfection</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> is a full LP of his raps, which have an interesting turn. The Deaf perspective is highlighted on the album in many songs in a variety of ways. A favorite off of </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Perfect Imperfection</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> is </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3q8W2XBSU4"><span style="font-weight:400;">“Def Deaf Girls,”</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> which flirts with the stereotype of rap songs about girls at clubs, but instead highlights the Deaf community’s women. Another, “Let’s Mambo,” mocks the stereotype of Deaf individuals not being able to dance. The</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2KYAlcTQno"><span style="font-weight:400;"> video</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> especially proves that idea wrong. </span></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/w2KYAlcTQno?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">These tracks all have a very unique window into the Deaf community that a lot of hearing individuals would never have thought of, placed in a comfort space for “hearies” music. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Though they’re a small group, Deaf rappers create great songs while making the world of music more accessible to the Deaf community. Sean Forbes, while not rapping, works on the company he co-founded, The Deaf Professional Arts Network (D-PAN). D-PAN is a media platform to promote Deaf artists in a variety of mediums, while also creating and producing music videos of popular songs into ASL.The accessibility of music, as well as the beauty and fluidity of ASL is something that hearing musicians are also beginning to catch on to. Earlier this month American Authors released an official video for their radio mix of popular song </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bAaN-LCcHI"><span style="font-weight:400;">“Pride” with Deaf broadway actress</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> Sandra Mae Frank doing an ASL interpretation. While the song itself is lovely, the beauty of Frank’s signing and expression is what has lead to this being on repeat for the last few weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">As most music fans know, music is more than just sound. Music is a way to provide feeling, to create a story and call forth different human connections. Why should the Deaf community be excluded from that because they simply can’t listen with their ears? There is so much more to it than just listening. Deaf musicians provide a very unique and valuable perspective in a space that we have made it hard for them to succeed, but succeeded they have. </span></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7852/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7852/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=7852&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>by <a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/lizzie">Lizzie Savage</a></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Ever since I began choosing the music I listened to, and not just listening to whatever was playing on the radio, my dad has criticized my music taste. It’s never anything too harsh; in general, the artists I like are too mellow to provoke serious feelings of resentment. But even still, I’ve heard it all&#8211;my music is “obnoxious,” and “it all sounds the same”; the artists are “talentless,” “awful people,” or even just plain “unoriginal.” And despite occasional praise, and the fact that deep down I know my dad doesn’t mean any harm with the comments he makes, it still hurts sometimes. It’s invalidating and discouraging, knowing that something so important to me isn’t taken seriously by other people, particularly adults.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">And I know I’m not alone. It feels like everywhere I look, young people are being criticized for all of their choices, and music is by no means an exception. But we “mindless kids” feel like we’ve been unfairly categorized as uneducated sheep, who only listen to the mainstream pop on the radio. In reality, that’s far from the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Just because new music sounds different doesn’t mean it’s bad.</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">I encourage adults to think back on their own experience growing up. I’m willing to bet most of their parents said the same things about their favorite bands that they’re saying about ours now. In fact, Michael Jackson’s “Black or White” video confirms this perfectly: as baby MaCaulay Culkin jams to Jackson in his room, his stereotypically cynical father yells at him that he’s wasting his time. The argument has been the same for so long, and instead of remembering the arguments they had with their parents over the same thing years ago, the parents of millennials have turned the argument around on the newer elements of popular music. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying there isn’t enough manufactured, artificial pop music out there. There’s a lot, and it’s hard to sift through all of the mediocre songs and artists in order to reach the good stuff. But that doesn’t take away from the fact that there is still plenty of good music out there, and there are just as many people enjoying it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The usually subtle disregard for young people’s ability to appreciate “real art” is always present, but it seems like every time something major happens in pop culture, the tension increases exponentially. After it was announced that David Bowie had died, it was all anyone talked about. Even now, more than a month later, I still hear him mentioned more than once a day. In real life as well as on the internet, music lovers everywhere took time to reflect on how Bowie had affected them. The death of the Eagles’ Glenn Frey a week later sparked a similar response. The statements I saw on social media were intriguing: older generations, those who grew up when Bowie’s career was still on the rise, were obviously broken up. But so were a huge amount of young people. My friends and peers were all sharing how they had been affected by the news, and their reactions to such a big loss were just as widespread and intense as the generations before them. But the thing that struck me more than that was how, following all these responses, the attitudes of many adults I heard from didn’t change a bit. I heard more people saying “young kids don’t know good music” and “there will never be anyone that legendary again” than ever. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Young musicians&#8211;real, genuine, self-made musicians&#8211;didn’t pull their sound out of thin air. Someone had to influence them, and most of the time it’s the bands that are older now and don’t fall in the category of current popular music. The musical styles and artists that are prominent now all stem from the past. The 1975 have stated they’ve been influenced by Michael Jackson and Talking Heads; Haim by The Eagles and Fleetwood Mac; Walk the Moon by Bowie and The Police. The same way that early rock‘n’roll evolved from blues, and pop evolved from rock and roll, artists take what they know and they make it their own. If millennials don’t listen to good music, how would they be influenced to create their own? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Young music consumers are also just as affected by old music as they are by music being produced right now. In fact, ask anyone who is passionate about music and it’s likely they’ll tell you that passion was sparked by the music their parents listened to. Personally, I grew up listening to everything from The Eagles to AC/DC to Seal. But even as my music taste evolved into what it is today, I remained affected by the music that I first fell in love with. Music is universal. It’s timeless. Trends come and go, but certain artists and themes stick around, and can be connected to regardless of the age of the listener. People are nostalgic for places they’ve been and feelings they’ve felt, but also for times and experiences they may never have lived through. And that’s something that older people tend to forget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">And then there’s the people who are convinced that there’s nobody out right now who’s as big as Bowie. Well, obviously. Arguing that no one today is as good or as revolutionary as the bands and performers who have been around for decades is absurd, because of course they aren’t. They haven’t had time! The Rolling Stones and the Beatles weren’t instantly iconic. Given the chance to evolve and grow in their art, there’s no doubt there are artists currently on the rise who will be every bit as influential and important as people like Bowie and the Eagles. They just aren’t getting the credit they deserve for what they’re capable of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Kids love music for what it is, not because it’s trendy. They’re looking for a connection, and an explanation of why they feel the way they do. They’re looking for other artists to inspire them and show them that they can create something amazing, too. Invalidating young people’s passion is seriously debilitating, and it’s an unhelpful habit if we want to have another artist like Bowie or another band like the Eagles anytime soon. So adults, think next time before you start hounding on a young person for the things they like. And young people &#8211; remember that it’s up to you to prove to the critics that they’re wrong.</span></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7254/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7254/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=7254&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[by Sarah Bel Kloetzke When I tell people that I almost exclusively go to shows with my mom, I usually get one of two reactions.

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">When I tell people that I almost exclusively go to shows with my mom, I usually get one of two reactions. The first, from someone who doesn’t attend concerts or isn’t really in the scene, is usually something along the lines of, “Wow! Your mom must be so cool!” I’ve received this reaction from some regular show goers, but more often than not, I get a more negative reaction, like, “That must suck,” or, “Isn’t that annoying?” or, “Aww, little baby.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Now, I’m definitely used to this. I’ve been going to shows with my mom since I was thirteen, if you don’t count that awesome Jonas Brothers concert when I was nine. For the first year, I was a little uncomfortable with it. I didn’t want to seem like a little kid in a room of tatted adults, but my love for the music overshadowed my worry for my image. My mom has grown to love the same music I love; her most jammed artist on her daily commute is William Beckett. In all honesty, music has united my mom and I throughout my teenage years in a way that I don’t believe would have ever happened if I hadn’t made her watch My Chemical Romance interviews when I was twelve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Younger fans seem to overlook the benefits of bringing their parent, if said parent is accepting of the music, to shows. I don’t have to worry about setting up a ride to and from the show if my most reliable transportation is there too. In a way, having my mom with me has made the music scene more accessible. Because I’m a minor, I can’t go to shows with age restrictions like 18 or 21+ unless I’m with a legal guardian. I have yet to find a venue that doesn’t allow my admission to these shows if my mom is with me. Learning this fact literally changed my life. Though, there’s a price to needing a ride and a companion to go to shows, when that companion is your fifty-plus-year-old mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">That aforementioned price is an obvious lack of respect for her by our fellow concert-goers. Show experiences have been dampened by blatant rudeness, and often times feelings get seriously hurt. The first incident I recall was at Warped Tour 2013, when a tall man in his early twenties purposely stood in front of Mom so she couldn’t see, and when she politely asked him if he could move over a bit, he responded with a snappy, “Why are you here anyway?” A few months later at a Pierce The Veil show, a security guard asked, “Aren’t you a little old to be watching this band?” I’d say the worst experience was at a Mayday Parade show, when a teenage boy in the crowd behind us repeatedly pushed and hit my mom’s back, trying to get her to leave the crowd. This infuriated headstrong fourteen-year-old me, and I eventually fled my great spot in the crowd with my mother in tow just to keep her safe. Another incident was just this last year, when a girl around thirteen years old told my mother that she didn’t deserve to be at the show, and later on in the night, dumped a jar of glitter on our heads, all because we had arrived before her and, apparently, got a spot on the balcony that the girl wanted. (Who brings a jar of glitter to a show???) Our bathroom looked like the set of a Ke$ha music video that night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I can’t quite pinpoint the cause of this blatant disrespect to older concert attendees. If it’s an all-ages scene, why is everyone 40+ being pushed out? The parents, and even those attendees without children, deserve to watch energizing, live music as much as the rest of us. I’m sixteen now but still without a driver’s license, so you’ll definitely still catch me at shows with my mom. Even with the acquisition of my license, I’ll continue to bring my mom to any shows she wants to attend. Younger fans such as myself definitely tend to forget that older adults love music too, and it’s something that should bring the generations together. So next time you’re at a show, please keep in mind that </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">everyone </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">deserves to be there and have a good time. Or, if you’re cooler than most and you see some major shading going on at a show, stand up for the older attendees!</span></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7113/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7113/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=7113&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>by <a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/genna/">Genna Skouge</a></em></p>
<p>To some people music is sacred. It’s personal. They fall in love with the music they constantly listen to and see live for a reason. Whether they like the lyrics, the style of music, the people in the band or even their stage presence. When listening to music and falling in love with an artist’s live performance, you never consider what it would feel like if they broke up and stopped creating music.</p>
<p>Minnesota is filled with amazing bands that know how to perform and put on a spectacular show. Minnesota is also filled with bands that have broken up for reasons unclear. I have witnessed at least 10 local bands break up in the past two years, which is a lot, especially since they were bands making something of themselves. In fact, some of them <em>were</em> very well known and loved by people from all over the United States. Some were even know in other countries.</p>
<p>Why do bands in Minnesota break up? Is it because Minnesota isn’t as supportive of local acts as we should be? Is it because the bands lost faith in themselves? Could it be that the individuals of the bands saw their dreams developing into something different? Is it because our local music scene is just simply shrinking in size? Or is it personal?</p>
<p>The Picture Perfect was founded in 2011 and became one of the most loved bands in the local pop scene. They treated their fans with the utmost respect and always put on a spectacular performance. The band called it quits in 2014 because they started to butt heads on the music. They all started to have personal differences. A couple of the members have continued music in other ways, the rest have pursued other things.</p>
<p>The Role Call was founded in 2012 and they also became very well known in the local pop scene. The Role Call went on a 20 day tour in the summer of 2013. They broke up in 2014 because over half of the band decided to move to different states to build careers-Steve and Max are both in Los Angeles, California and Joey is building a career in Tennessee. Both Joe and Kristoff decided to stay in their home state.</p>
<p>We Are The Blog! was founded in 2009. A post-core metal band that was known in other countries as well. The band broke up in fall of 2015 because half of the members decided to start another band named Empty My Lungs, one of the members joined a different band and another member just decided music wasn’t necessarily his go to career. They also struggled with some personal differences. We Are The Blog! Was one of the most well known metal bands in Minnesota.</p>
<p>As you can see there are many reasons as to why a band breaks up. I believe it’s time for the scene to come together as one and constantly support each other’s dreams. Who knows what the local music scene will look like six months from now. We are a family and we should definitely stay that way. Minnesota has a solid scene that should probably take over the world. Really though. That’s how awesome our scene is.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7100/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7100/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=7100&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>by <a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/sararosa/">Sararosa Davies</a></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A couple years ago, I discovered an artist named Tom Milsom and slowly but surely got into his music. I bought some songs, then some albums, and on it went. I listened enough to read his Wikipedia page and watch some of his Youtube videos, but never became as rapt with him as I was with other artists. A year after I started listening to him, a couple of women that Milsom dated came out with allegations of abuse and rape. At the same time, other women came out with numerous other counts against other Youtubers, the most of them musicians. I had trouble making sense of the music Milsom made and how it conflicted with his horrible behavior. I eventually deleted his music from my library, and stopped listening to him altogether. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I do not want to support artists that use their power to abuse others. This is a practice that I have picked up recently, but it has been incredibly hard to stick to. I am plagued by this question: How do I stop supporting an artist who has been so essential to my trajectory as a music listener? Though I wasn’t a huge fan of Milsom’s work, his music got me interested in other Youtube musicians. Those musicians were huge for me at the time. It is still hard for me to look back and separate my fond memories of their music with the acts they did. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">As a community, we can’t implicitly support abuse and sexual assault by ignoring it when it’s by artist we like. Yet, often we stick to artists who do these things because we like their art.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">How do we unstick ourselves from artists who take advantage of other people, often younger, when we love the art they make? As a socially conscious person, am I still woke if I have trouble letting go of someone like David Bowie who has done things I disagree with on a deep level </span><a href="https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/i-lost-my-virginity-to-david-bowie"><span style="font-weight:400;">(having sex with a minor</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/from-heil-hitler-to-shalom-tel-aviv-the-many-incarnations-of-david-bowie/"><span style="font-weight:400;">saying some fascist things,</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> etc)?  I was mad that I felt sad after his death, I was mad that I had supported a rapist. And yet, I listened to his music that day, trying to make sense of all those thoughts. How do I reconcile this love of music and the discovery of new artists with the unbearable fact that artists have the potential to abuse their power?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I don’t know the definite answers to any of these questions, but I think I am starting to figure them out. Here are some of my not-so-concrete, ever-changing “rules” for dealing with the problems that come with being a socially woke person who loves art and music. </span></p>
<p><b>First, I try remember that art is complex and that the world that surrounds it is complex</b><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I could go on and on about aesthetics and what makes art what it is, but for the sake of time, I’ll say this: Art is subjective. The artist has their own interpretation of their work and so does every single member of the audience. Maybe the artist made the song for themselves or maybe it&#8217;s for an audience. I think about Lizzo’s song, “My Skin,” in comparison to Macklemore’s “White Privilege II” when it comes to this. Both songs make strong statements about important social issues, Macklemore’s about racism and white privilege, while Lizzo’s is about women and women owning their own bodies. The songs explore the internal thought process we all go through when it comes to our opinions on said issues. Both songs come from places of internal struggle, but because of context, who made them, and the time of release, people’s responses varied. Critics of Macklemore’s song stress the idea that people will listen to a white man, Macklemore, talk about racism, but will disregard people of color who talk about it. People who like the song stress the attention Macklemore brings to the issue. Lizzo is a woman, making a song for women and women responded to the song with praise. Other people might have had different ideas. Artists might not be able to predict how an audience responds because their art is personal to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The same thing goes for us as listeners. Whether or not you like a song and its message, it is still art. Other people are going to interpret it differently because that’s what we all do. Music, and all art in general, lives in more than just one world. Remembering this helps us move through controversies in a more graceful manner, even if the conversations we have are anything but graceful or easy.</span></p>
<p><b>Second, I try to involve myself in communities where I feel safe. </b><b>If there are any</b><span style="font-weight:400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But in order for these communities to exist, we need to actively create them. This is especially important in music when it comes to certain scenes. If a member of a group does something like sexually assault or abuse someone, that person can’t stay in the group. Don’t buy their music, don’t book them in shows. Don’t let them be paid. They have to understand that their behavior is not okay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This isn’t easy at all. I am guilty of supporting artists (and people) who have done bad things, sometimes out of ignorance and sometimes out of confusion. When another Youtube artist, Alex Day, was also accused of abuse, I continued to listening to him. Then, after getting up the courage to read testimonies of the women he abused, I stopped. Sometimes I have no idea about what happened concerning the artist, sometimes I refuse to believe certain accounts of a story of sexual assault. I hate it when I do that. I am entirely guilty of not paying attention to the controversies because I am not ready to address the complexities of an artist. I am still actively working on this for many reasons. I want to stick to my values, I want to improve.  When I have an urge to revisit Tom Milsom’s videos or to see what he’s up to, I use all the self control I have to click away or turn on some other music. I try to remember all the accounts of abuse I read. I try to look up political artists who stand against the things he did. I try to surround myself with other art.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The thing is, when enough people ignore or dismiss an artist’s actions, it’s enabling. This is not to say we should create communities that are bent only on punishing the artist and do nothing for ourselves. Instead the focus should be on the positive changes we can make for ourselves. I am a member of an awesome Facebook group for female-identifying and non-binary people in the Minnesota music industry. This community was created in response to the sexism that permeates the music industry both here and elsewhere. What began as a place to vent, became a community of huge, warm support. We go to each other’s shows, post each other’s articles, and start discussions about what all of this means to us. Rather than focusing on what others can do, we change what we can for ourselves.</span></p>
<p><b>And third, I am wary of idolizing an artist.  I try to be aware that the musicians I like are all human, complex, and “problematic.”</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">By putting the musicians we like on the same level as us, as hard as it may be, we are immediately looking at them from a different point of view. When we idolize artists, we disservice many. We disservice ourselves because we make musicians seem more than human. We give them huge amounts of praise and forget ourselves. We’re devastated when they don’t live up to our expectations. For survivors of sexual assault it can be hard when the general public talks continues to idolize perpetrators. (Ahem. </span><a href="http://mic.com/articles/132399/the-complicated-sexual-history-of-david-bowie"><span style="font-weight:400;">Bowie</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. </span><a href="http://www.dailydot.com/fandom/tom-milsom-underage-sex-scandal/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Milsom. Alex Day</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. </span><a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/music/read-the-stomach-churning-sexual-assault-accusations-against-r-kelly-in-full-6637412"><span style="font-weight:400;">R. Kelly</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. etc) It can be incredibly </span><a href="http://www.theestablishment.co/2016/01/11/david-bowie-rape-accusations-sexual-assault/"><span style="font-weight:400;">traumatic. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">None of this is easy, graceful, or fun. But when it comes to consuming art, it’s important to think about your values. I am still trying to figure this out and likely will be for a long time. Things ebb and flow, artists come and go. Sometimes the best music is made by horrible people, and it’s okay to be figuring out what those people mean to you. There are no bad questions when it comes to this. Because if you are asking questions, that means you are thinking. And that’s only the start.</span></p>

<p>Over the past few months, numerous bands have announced upcoming spring and summer tours. You think this would be an exciting time for concertgoers. Seeing who’s going on tour with whom, and when they’re coming to your local city. That’s all fine and dandy, until they announce a tour and neglect to include Minnesota.</p>
<p>Here are some awesome upcoming tours that I wouldn’t hesitate to purchase a ticket for if they actually came to Minnesota.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Story So Far w/ Comeback Kid and Culture Abuse</li>
<li>Panic! At The Disco and Weezer summer tour w/ special guests</li>
<li>Tonight Alive spring tour w/ special guests</li>
<li>Issues w/ Crown The Empire &amp; special guests</li>
<li>Brand New and Modest Mouse summer tour w/ special guests</li>
<li>State Champs &amp; Neck Deep World Tour w/ special guests</li>
</ul>
<p>Last summer, I saw Brand New when they made a stop in Minnesota on their summer tour. The show was incredible and the turn out was ridiculous. When I found out they were going on a summer tour again and with Modest Mouse, I was shocked they weren’t making a stop here. With such a successful turn out last time in Minnesota, why wouldn’t they come back?</p>
<p>I was also quite surprised that State Champs and Neck Deep weren’t making a stop here on their world tour. I mean really? It’s a WORLD TOUR. Just make a stop in Minnesota. Is that really too much to ask for?</p>
<p>Normally I would say bands don’t want to come here because its ungodly cold out during the winter. But most of these tours are taking place during the summer, so there goes that excuse.</p>
<p>Maybe people are sick of the whole “Minnesota Nice” thing? I mean, I know I sure am.</p>
<p>Or maybe they can never tell if they’re in St. Paul or Minneapolis and quite frankly, are getting sick of it. I’m running out of possible ideas here…</p>
<p>All I’m asking is if someone could explain to me why none of these tours are coming to Minnesota. Don’t try to make excuses like you “couldn’t book a venue” or “it just didn’t work out.” Well, why didn’t it work out? Please enlighten me because I’m completely lost.</p>
<p>Long rant short, I’m very disappointed that I won’t be seeing any of these tours this year. I guess the lack of my favorite bands coming to Minnesota is all the more reason why I need to leave this state, or just drive 6 hours to Chicago to see a show. Because god knows you can’t go on tour (OR WORLD TOUR) and not go to Chicago…</p>
<p>If you’re upset that your favorite bands are going on tour and not coming to a city near you, I feel your pain, especially if you live in North Dakota. In that case, I shouldn’t even be complaining. Do they even have music venues there?</p>

<p><em>by <a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/maddy/">Maddy Siiter</a></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In a small local music scene like Duluth, everyone supports everyone. If someone comes out to see your show on a Friday night, you go out to see theirs the next Friday night. It’s not a hard concept to follow. You hear about the show, meet up with your friends, show the bouncer your ID, maybe order a drink and wait for the music to start. Fun, right? Yeah, if you’re of legal drinking age. It really sucks if you’re only 16. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The majority of the venues that regularly host music here are bars, or serve alcohol, meaning that by law, if you’re under 21 you have to be out of there at a certain time of the night. Or you’re just not allowed in at all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">As a teenage musician, it’s frustrating to have such little access to something I care so much about. I’m supported so fervently around town that it almost feels undeserved because I can rarely return the favor. I can get into venues if I’m playing them, because then I’m technically working. What if I want to reciprocate the support from a band by going out to their show in return? I can’t. I’m not old enough. Sorry, five-year raincheck? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I know these places need to make money to stay open and that that money is usually all made from alcohol sales. I know it’d be dumb to let in people who you legally can’t make a profit from. I know owners are scared of accidentally serving people who are underage. But please, just charge me for water and X the top my hands with permanent marker. I would gladly pay for something you usually give away and rock a sign of my youth if it meant I could support a band who deserves a crowd. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Maybe safety has something to do with it, something I agree with and do appreciate. Unfortunately, some adults can’t responsibly handle themselves with alcohol in public. I know I have people around me that would watch out for me in that setting, but not every small teenage girl and her friends are that lucky. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I get it though, maybe some 25-year-old cool kids don’t want obnoxious teenagers in their usual hang out space. They think all we’re going to do is be loud and text the whole time, but that’s wrong. Just look around at this website. Teenagers like music too. </span></p>
<p>We deserve to enjoy it like everyone else. If we made the point of coming (spending gas money) and willingly paid the $5 cover (more money), we want to be there. Broke teenagers will not spend money for nothing. Broke teenagers will not spend money to not pay attention to what they paid for. But please though, continue to roll your eyes and mumble under your breath that, “those stupid kids are always on their phones.” I know you just posted that on Facebook from your iPhone.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The next generation of a music scene cannot happen if you don’t allow the bands and musicians who make it up to actively be a part of it. Sure, there are a handful of all-age venues and </span><a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/2015/09/08/live-in-mn-duluths-super-big-block-party/"><span style="font-weight:400;">events</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, but sometimes you want something different from the acoustic, coffeeshop environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s almost impossible to meet other bands if you can’t be where they are (and they’re usually not at these coffee places on a Friday night). What makes you think a lot of young bands are going to stay ambitious if they feel alienated, even if they can’t control it? It’s not my fault when I was born.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s not just the kids that want to be around. The adults want the kids around too. Local musicians I’ve met in their 20s and 30s feel the same way. These people have not only listened to various forms of this same rant, but have brought it up themselves, because again, they’re worried about keeping something we all love going. </span></p>
<p>I don’t have all the answers to this and I don’t know everything, but something has to change if you want to keep this alive and draw in a bigger, more diverse crowd. It’s not fair to be on the outside of everything, because having to deal with that in high-school is bad enough. Music is supposed to be a creative, safe outlet, regardless of age.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/6262/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/6262/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=6262&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If you&#8217;re talking about alt-rock or pop-punk in Minnesota, odds are Motion City Soundtrack is going to come up sooner rather than later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">That&#8217;s how it was for my aunt at least, who put them at the top of the mixtape she made for me seven years ago when she heard my family was moving here. She claimed it was part of my &#8220;Minnesota Music-ation&#8221; and assumed that since I was already obsessed with bands like Fall Out Boy and Weezer that I would like them too. She was right, of course, and even before the boxes were packed and the moving truck was loaded up, I had already planned out what I would do if I ever ran into them. The odds must be pretty high, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Well, wrong. Despite the fact that I now lived in their city, their expansive touring took them basically everywhere but home. By then I probably had a better chance of seeing them if I&#8217;d stayed in Virginia, but that ship had set sail as they went on basically every Warped Tour in the next seven years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But September 19th I finally did it. I saw Motion City Soundtrack. And it was everything ten-year-old me had ever dreamed of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In celebration of the release of their new album </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Panic Stations</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, they were to play and do a signing at Electric Fetus for everyone who bought the album there. The tweet announcing it drifted through my feed a couple weeks before the show and I immediately knew I had to go. I&#8217;d been to this kind of thing there before and the fact that Electric Fetus was another part of my original &#8220;Minnesota Music-ation&#8221;, well, I was excited, to say the least.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Thanks to the rain and traffic, I only got there a few minutes before they were supposed to let people stand in front of the stage. When they said you were only guaranteed entry if you preordered the album, I was worried it would be super crowded, but that wasn&#8217;t really necessary; a fair few people showed up, but not enough that it was ridiculously packed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Standing somewhere between Joni Mitchell and Muse (in retrospect, right in front of the rest of Motion City&#8217;s discography), it wasn&#8217;t that long before my side of the crowd had to shuffle in closer to make room for the band to get to the stage. As mics were adjusted and guitars were plugged in, casual conversation flowed between those onstage and off. The entire setup was low key and comfortable, one of the best parts of any show at Electric Fetus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Once everyone was ready and tuned and everything, the band launched into &#8220;TKO,&#8221; the first single off the new album. They were tight and in sync, and it sounded almost as though someone had shut off all the amps and just played the actual album instead. It makes sense, seeing as that&#8217;s how they tracked the album in the first place; all playing together in one room instead of separate takes for separate instruments. They did it to capture the energy of their live performances and, after listening to the actual recording after, I have to admit that they did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Justin Pierre, the lead singer, was a little all over the place in every way; hair wild as always, forgetting which songs they&#8217;d already released, but still looking like he was having the best time. It was only fitting then that their next song was &#8220;Lose Control,&#8221; also from </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Panic Stations</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">. Despite the fact that the stage was barely big enough for all five of them to have their own space, they were still giving it all the energy of a stadium show. Even with so many people in the way, it was easy to spot drummer Claudio Rivera as he rocketed out of his seat with every bass kick and the tiny fan in front of him blew the hair out of his face like he was in a cliché music video. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s so hard to rock out in a two inch area,&#8221; Justin said, &#8220;but I&#8217;m trying.&#8221; Everyone was. It was fantastic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">When he forgot that they&#8217;d already released the next song, Justin decided to listen to guitarist Joshua Cain&#8217;s advice and take a break to draw inspiration from Tom Waits, his idol, whose face was hanging from the ceiling nearby on a sign promoting his most recent album. Justin had an entire conversation with it and eventually his hyperbolically low Waits voice gave him the strength to pull it together for the next song. They played a couple more songs from </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Panic Stations</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, including the brand new &#8220;I Can Feel You&#8221;, and told some more jokes about Justin living in the basement of the record store before finally delving into that expansive and well-loved back catalogue of theirs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">When they played &#8220;Last Night&#8221;, the first song of theirs I ever heard, that feeling from before came rushing back. It was everything ten-year-old me who&#8217;d never been to a concert before thought it should be; loud, intimate, and just plain fun. Even when Justin dropped out for a few seconds as he forgot the words, the crowd carried the song for him until he could jump back in. &#8220;Everything is Alright&#8221; was next and had that same feeling of gut-wrenching solidarity with everyone shouting back the lines &#8220;yeah, everything is alright&#8221; whenever Justin leaned back from the mic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">As soon as they had finished, people started clearing the stage and immediately lining up for the signing afterwards. The sizable crowd whittled down to mostly just those who had preordered their vinyl or whatever, but it still took a while for the whole line to wind its way through the rows of vinyl back to the counter. Waiting in that line you pretty much immediately became friends with the people next to you; the people behind me and I recommended albums to each other as we slowly edged towards the front, we made jokes about weird album titles and the fact that pretty much all of Celine Dion&#8217;s discography was in the discount bins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Eventually it was my turn and thankfully I didn&#8217;t feel nearly as nervous as I thought I would be. Seven years had been long enough for me to mellow to the idea of meeting them so when I walked up and they immediately struck up conversation about my Star Wars shirt, it felt familiar and casual. Apparently the keyboardist, Jesse Johnson, knew someone high up at Disney who had already seen the new movie, which led to them talking about how long they&#8217;d been fans of the series, which I took as my opening to mention how long I&#8217;d been fans of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Josh immediately laughed out an apology, but they seemed impressed as I explained about my aunt&#8217;s mixtape seven years ago. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been listening to our music longer than my kid&#8217;s been alive,&#8221; Josh remarked, which I suppose is true. I told them this was the first show of theirs I had been able to go to and that it was just as great as I had always hoped it would be. Justin promised they would see me again sometime, we took a semi-awkward picture, and I left and tried not to have a breakdown on the way to the car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">When I told them it was everything I&#8217;d hoped it would be, I got the feeling that they thought I was just saying that because I felt I had to, but I wasn&#8217;t. Words failed me in that moment, but listening to my new (signed!) CD on the ride home, I figured out why it felt so incredible. It was joy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Pure unadulterated joy has always been an important part of any Motion City Soundtrack record and, while it got a little lost for a few albums in the middle, the new one brought that back in full force. </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Panic Stations</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> is fun, with that same synth-heavy pop punk sound that has become Motion City, and hearing them perform those songs are even more so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Its new melodies to get stuck in your head for weeks on end. It&#8217;s more lyrics that hit you in just the right place. It&#8217;s exactly why the ten-year-old version of me loved them from the first song, and it&#8217;s why seventeen-year-old me had the best time of their life seeing them last week.</span></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/5717/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/5717/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=5717&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>July 21, 2013 otherwise known as my first Warped Tour. While stumbling around the overwhelming festival grounds with nothing in particular on my agenda, I came across Tonight Alive. My impatience to see a show dragged me into a crowd where I gazed up as drummer, Matty Best, came out alone to begin the intro.</p>
<p>Before this moment, my only experience with a female-fronted band was with Paramore. Prior to my discovery of Paramore, female singers to me were hardly more than a bunch of over-stylized pop stars focused more on selling albums and appealing to the average 13-year-old girl than creating music that truly meant something. As you can imagine, Paramore took me to another planet. They had rock guitars, honest lyrics, and a female vocalist who stood for all the right things. I never thought I would run across a band of similar nature, and then Jenna McDougall appeared out of the Warped Tour heavens.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zo5aZYdSqxI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>The rest of the band filed out and burst straight into “Listening.” I couldn’t believe my eyes; Jenna was headbanging harder than the four males on stage. Then the heavy guitars pulled back and made way for her voice. The fast-paced drums raced behind the muted guitars as she sang at a beautiful low hum, “Naive minds for naive lives. We don&#8217;t have nine lives open your eyes. The only chance you get is here tonight.” Not only was I entranced by her strong voice, her words struck me. They had real power; gave me real motivation to better myself… and this was only the first song! My dreams of finding another Paramore were coming true right before my eyes.</p>
<p>The set powered on through more songs like “Starlight,” “The Ocean,” and “Wasting Away.” Each song was more energetic and relatable than the last. After summoning dozens of crowd surfers and delivering unbelievable notes, Jenna asked us to raise our middle fingers. Her head hung a moment as we all stood in unison in the rebellious pose. “These go out to anyone who ever told you that you weren’t good enough… Refuse to live in fear of some one else’s judgment.” Then the band broke into an anthem that reinforced Jenna’s influential speech, titled, “What Are You So Scared Of?” I left feeling more empowered than ever before, all thanks to this hard rocking woman who took my favorite aspects of Hayley Williams and intensified them.</p>
<p>This moment, my first with Tonight Alive, created an addiction. I was so blown away by my entire experience that I wanted more. I immediately proceeded to the band’s merch tent to acquire all of their music available. I even sought out to give Jenna a hug for opening my eyes to this whole side of music I never knew existed. The rest of my summer quickly became a mission to find similar bands. The countless hours spent scouring the Internet led to the discovery of some of my favorite bands today such as We Are The In Crowd, Pvris, and Sleeper Agent. Each of these bands possesses attributes similar to those of Tonight Alive but take on a sound of their own. Pvris for example, share Tonight Alive’s hard-rock/punk influences but have expanded the genres by infusing their own electronic twist. Tonight Alive even introduced me another phenomenal female-fronted band firsthand when indie-pop band, Echosmith, appeared as an opening act at their first headlining show in Minnesota.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8aQz-aKvyQU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Song by song, Tonight Alive helped me build a whole knew music catalog. They showed me that you don’t have to be Hayley Williams to put on a good rock show as a woman. You don’t have to be Hayley to inspire people from a woman’s point of view, and you don’t have to be Hayley to be an outstanding woman singing in the midst of a scene riddled with men. Tonight Alive was simply my gateway into an addictive scene filled with women who rock, and for that I could never thank them enough.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/5452/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/5452/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=5452&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
