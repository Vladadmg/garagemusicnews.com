<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Since Arctic Monkeys announced an indefinite hiatus in 2014, there hasn’t been much news about them, up until a few months ago when it was announced that The Last Shadow Puppets (a supergroup comprised of Arctic Monkeys’ frontman Alex Turner and former The Rascals’ frontman Miles Kane) were to release their first album since 2008. Following a handful of singles, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Everything You’ve Come to Expect</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> was released on April 1, providing 2016 with a much-needed dose of Baroque pop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I’m only somewhat familiar with Kane’s music, so I first dove into TLSP’s new release with Arctic Monkeys’ latest album, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">AM</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, on my mind. Upon reaching the end of the last track on </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Everything You’ve Come To Expect</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, I was slightly bemused to have discovered that it actually was everything I had come to expect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The album, which was recorded in Malibu, shows a similar evolution to that of Arctic Monkeys’ albums, reflecting </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">AM</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> and Kane’s 2011 solo album, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Colour of the Trap</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, the same way the Last Shadow Puppets’ 2008 debut, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">the Age of Understatement</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, reflected Arctic Monkeys&#8217; earlier albums. Compared to its precursor, however, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Everything You’ve Come to Expect</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> is dreamier, and infused fairly evenly with influence from both Kane and Turner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Although the album never dwindles, and is a worthy soundtrack to pair with sunglasses and leather, the best tracks by far are “Sweet Dreams, TN,” which sounds like it came straight off of </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">AM</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, and “the Dream Synopsis,” a swirly, surreal number dripping with nostalgia and deserving of a place on Turner’s 2010 soundtrack to the Richard Ayoade film </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Submarine</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">. The album’s overall atmosphere is reminiscent to a classic action-mystery novel&#8211;crooning, semi-dark, and seductively whimsical. The lyrics are full of rambling metaphors and vaguely anecdotal lines that identify them as Turner’s, but lack the seriousness and introspectiveness that frequently saturates Turner’s writing. The level of self-imitation varies between songs, from the short, seemingly unrelated statements in “Bad Habits” to the excessively advanced wording choices in “Aviation.” (What does “sectoral heterochromia” mean?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The lines that best summarize the album’s overall mindset&#8211;meritable melodies paired with </span><span style="font-weight:400;">sesquipedalian, borderline humorous lyrics&#8211;</span><span style="font-weight:400;">appear in “Miracle Aligner”:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">He was born to blow your mind,</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Or something along those lines</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">And in the title track:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Baby it&#8217;s a never ending spiral</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Looks a little bit like Paris</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A strong, albeit late, follow-up to The Last Shadow Puppets’ debut, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Everything You’ve Come to Expect</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> elicits a characteristic reaction: it makes you want to dance, but a kind of choreographed dancing that’s really just posing. And with a European tour in progress and finally new material, we can only hope for an Arctic Monkeys-&amp; Miles Kane-revival soon, too.</span></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/8086/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/8086/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=8086&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Starting their show off like this is just one way the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrollton,_Kentucky"><span style="font-weight:400;">Carrollton, Kentucky</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> hard rock band, XXI, continues to catch the attention of many music-lovers from across the country.

Carson Butcher (former drummer of AFFK) took on lead vocals for XXI and Robbie Barnett (former bassist of AFFK) moved to drums, while Seth Weigand and Jamie King remained on guitars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">On Wednesday, March 30, XXI came to THE GARAGE in Burnsville, MN on Affiance’s </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Gaia</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> EP Release Tour. In addition to Affiance and XXI, the tour included post-hardcore acts It Lives, It Breathes, Versus, and Set to Stun. During each of the band’s sets, members from other bands on the tour came on stage and danced, sang guest vocals, and pulled crazy tour pranks. At one point, they even started taking away Versus’ drumset in the middle of a song. All of the bands were also very interactive with the audience, especially XXI. There were several times when lead vocalist Carson Butcher invited people on stage to sing along, and handed the microphone off to people in the audience. One song that seemed to get the crowd moving even more than they already were was “Say it Again.” This is one of those songs that you’ll put on repeat for days on end because you just can’t get enough of it. Everyone was so immersed in the song that it seemed like the audience and other bands were singing into the microphone and rocking out on stage more than XXI was. So many times when people go to concerts, they expect to mostly watch the musicians perform, but XXI made it feel as though we were performing </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">with</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> the band.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Going into this show, I had no idea what to expect from XXI’s performance; I had only ever just heard their CD, but XXI blew my mind and surpassed all expectations, making them one of the best live shows I have ever seen. I highly recommend that everyone sees XXI if they have the chance &#8211; it will be well worth the time. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">On Sunday, April 3rd local pop/rock band Time Atlas will be releasing their new EP </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Obscurity</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8211;a selection of reimagined songs from their debut EP </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Clarity. </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">In the meantime, I’ve been given the opportunity to chat with frontman Grayson DeWolfe about the new batch of music, along with giving the trio of tunes a listen myself.</span></p>
<p><b><em>GMN</em>: When were these tracks recorded?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">DeWolfe: </span></i><i><span style="font-weight:400;">The songs we recorded by ourselves over at (bassist Kristoff Druva’s) studio over the past couple months or so. It&#8217;s been an ongoing project that we&#8217;ve wanted to do for a while but never had the opportunity with so many shows in the fall.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><b><em>GMN</em>: </b>How did you select the tracks you wanted to rework? Personal opinion or fan popularity?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;"><i><span style="font-weight:400;">DeWolfe: </span></i>We chose each track based on potential. We wanted it to be something new for our fans while still having its roots tied to </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">Clarity</span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">. So, if a song presented itself coming in a different way, then we took the idea and flew with it. “Sleepless Nights” was an easy first choice. I had been playing a piano version of (guitarist Josh Bening’s) opening riff for a long time, and we eventually incorporated it into our acoustic set, and now our new EP. The bridge of “Sleepless Nights” gets wild too.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><b><em>GMN</em>: </b>On “Falling”:</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;"><i><span style="font-weight:400;">DeWolfe: </span></i>Back when I was writing “Falling” for the first time I always wanted some string instruments to shine in the pre-chorus and shape the song. In the original song, guitars drive the song forward, but this time around I wrote four string parts for a string quartet. We had them come in and play the music I put in front of them, and I couldn&#8217;t be happier with how it came out. They really drive the song and make it beautifully original, almost like it&#8217;s a brand new song.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><b><em>GMN</em>: </b>So you brought in an actual string quartet?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;"><i><span style="font-weight:400;">DeWolfe: </span></i>Yes! Well, sorta. We had my high school friend Davis come in with cello, and a college friend named Tasha who is an excellent violin player. I wrote two parts each for them, composing with harmonies for their own parts. The cello acted as a mid range voice, and also the bass line of the song.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><b><em>GMN</em>: </b>“Falling”</b> <b>is featuring Chicago band Marina City, want to tell me about that?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;"><i><span style="font-weight:400;">DeWolfe: </span></i>Yes! We&#8217;ve been super close with that entire band ever since we toured with them in August. Now whenever Marina City comes to Minnesota on tour, they always stay with one of us, even if it means all six of them cramming into an apartment. One night over the winter they were staying with Kristoff and Josh and quickly recorded vocals of “Falling” in Kristoff&#8217;s bedroom before leaving for their next stop. We&#8217;ve got such a close bond with that band, I doubt that this&#8217;ll be the last time we collaborate.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><b><em>GMN</em>: </b>On “Too Late”:</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;"><i><span style="font-weight:400;">DeWolfe: </span></i>“Too Late” honestly almost didn&#8217;t make the cut because I was hesitant on making a stripped down version of a song that was already stripped down a lot. My guitar player Josh insisted though, so I recorded a one take of me playing piano and singing in my bedroom studio and sent it to the guys. A week later it was fully recorded and is a key component to </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">Obscurity</span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">After talking to DeWolfe about the tracks, I gave them a listen myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The first track of the three is one of my favorite Time Atlas songs: “Falling</span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">”</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">Listening to it, I’m immediately graced with the strum of an acoustic guitar before being met with a gentler version of the poppy song. I notice how honest Grayson DeWolfe’s voice sounds, and it’s obvious that his vocals have improved since the initial recording of the track on the </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Clarity </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">EP</span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">The acoustic aspect of the song gives it a drastically different vibe. It sounds intimate, relaxing, and like you’re sitting in front of a fireplace on a chilly day. The sweeping strings of the “quartet” were definitely a good call on the musicians’ part, pulling the track together so it’s definitely not just</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">another typical acoustic song.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The second song chosen to be reworked is “Sleepless Nights.” After seeing Time Atlas live a few times, I’ve gathered that this one is a fan favorite. The beginning of the new version is definitely not what I was expecting-instead of a glittering guitar riff I’m met with an almost melancholy piano part. It’s like it’s a completely new song. There’s a sort of lightness to the original track that isn’t present in this new one, and the song sounds heavy, laced with new meaning. Now, this isn’t a negative thing. I find myself listening to this track more closely, thinking about the lyrics more and really taking in the instrumentals. The bridge of “Sleepless Nights”</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">on </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Clarity </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">is a narration of hope and determination, and practically a battle cry for the dedicated fans of Time Atlas. This aspect of the bridge is very different now, and this aspect of the bridge is now materialized differently*. The song ends strong, with “I will fight until I die!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The last song of the trio is “Too Late,” a simplistic acoustic song I’ve definitely witnessed some people cry to. In order to make this new version minimalistic, the acoustic guitar is replaced with piano, and there aren’t any backing vocals present. This gives a great effect to the song, making it seem more personal, like you’re reading DeWolfe’s journal. The young singer’s vocals are dynamic, drifting from soft words to strong phrases smoothly, his voice filled with power and the aforementioned honesty. It’s a great ending to </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Obscurity</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">. After listening to these tracks a few times and comparing them to </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Clarity</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, I’ve decided that these are definitely new </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">improved, and I very much look forward to seeing how other fans feel about these new versions of the songs on Sunday.</span></p>

<p><em>by <a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/sarahbel">Sarah Bel Kloetzke</a></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Five years ago, in March of 2011, Panic! At The Disco released their third full-length album, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Vices &amp; Virtues</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">. The album was released on Fueled By Ramen at a bleak time for the Las Vegas band after they had lost half of their members, one being their main lyricist, in 2009. </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Vices &amp; Virtues</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> is a pivotal album in the history of Panic! At The Disco, and in honor of it being kindergarden-age, I’ve decided to revisit it track-by-track.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I press play on my mp3 and am immediately met by the familiar and mysterious chiming notes of “The Ballad Of Mona Lisa.” It’s light, it’s suspenseful, and promising a new future for the band. Then I’m hit by a wall of sound&#8211;a strong drumbeat, rolling bass, and frontman Brendon Urie’s strong voice singing like he’s telling a secret. The song feels as mysterious as the Mona Lisa itself, of course, in this song she’s a metaphor for something less static. “Woah Mona Lisa, I’d pay to see you frown.”</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">This song is the perfect opening track for the album, setting a velvet-covered, gold trimmed, peculiar stage.</span></p>
<p>I love the transition between “The Ballad Of Mona Lisa” and “Let’s Kill Tonight” because there isn’t one. The change from twinkling notes to a drum machine beat is harsh, and perfect. I know that the first track was a slow introduction, and this one is where the action starts. The lyrics are clever up until the chorus, where a simple “Let’s kill tonight! Show them all you’re not the ordinary type,” gets the point across along with some pretty sick dracula-esque synths. I don’t know whether to dance to this song or defeat some brooding evil. Ending with a chorus of string instruments, this track leaves me feeling energized and ready for whatever this eclectic LP throws at me next.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Once I get past the initial confusion of the opening sample in “Hurricane” it’s clear this is my second favorite song of the album. It’s very typical of a poppy artist to use clapping, but it’s used artfully in this track, with a fast-paced beat that I always enjoy trying to keep up with. “Are you worth your weight in gold? ‘Cause you’re behind my eyelids when I’m all alone. Hey stranger, I want you to catch me like a cold.”</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">The lyrics of this quick track are coy, witty, and almost provoking, and accompanied by a fun, Latin-inspired beat make for a great party song. It ends with an instrumental that brings me back to the mysterious vibes that opened the album.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The next song is a fan favorite, but not quite my cup of tea. In “Memories,” Urie sings of his longing for a time in the past, and the perils of being unable to grasp it while following the narrative of a young couple falling apart. The beat is dynamic and driven by rocking guitars and violin, with a powerful solo and a soft-but-tense bridge. However, it all seems quite flat to me. The transition from the fourth track to “Trade Mistakes” is smooth and well done, with the fifth track coming in with sweeping violins. I love the light and almost fairy-like verses of this song, but the chorus does nothing for me. The lyrics in the chorus are clever, however, with Urie belting “If I could trade mistakes for sheep, count me away before you sleep.”</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">“Memories” and “Trade Mistakes” are a nice cool down after the energetic songs before them, but they leave me unsatisfied and ready for the action to build again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Ready to Go (Get Me Out Of My Mind)” sounds like new hope to me. Whether it’s hope for life in general or hope for what the album still has to offer, I don’t know. But if this song is anything to base the rest of the album on, I know I’m in for good things. The instrumental opening sounds like something to have blaring from my car’s speakers in the summertime, windows down, and a smiling face in the passenger seat. However, when Urie’s smooth vocals are introduced with the discreet bass line, that sunshiney summer day transitions to a neon metropolis at night&#8211;a different vibe containing the same magic. This song definitely follows the Panic! version of pop with an extremely simple chorus, but I don’t mind, for the instrumentals make up for it. Especially with the chiming decrescendo in the bridge and those ever-present strings. “Ready To Go” gets me, well, ready to go on with the dynamic album.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Always” is not what I expected after the previous track, but what’s not to like about the charming love tune? It’s a cute song and I can’t help singing along. “When the world gets too heavy put it on my back, I’ll be your levy.”</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">The instrumentals are artful, with acoustic guitar and a simple-yet-important drum beat continuously building into something more. That something more includes an obligatory violin, soft brass, and lyrics that grow less cute and more melancholy up until the end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“The Calendar” is along the lines of “Memories” lyrically. Urie seems to be singing about the collapse, or at least the faltering, of a romantic relationship. For some reason, perhaps the heavy use of floor toms in the drum beat, this song reminds me of a jungle. It’s almost like an ominous presence is in the groovy, upbeat song. Then the lyrics are back to being witty and it almost sounds provoking. “The Calendar” is a great mix of light and dark moods. At the end of the song we’re visited once again by an instrumental interlude, sounding like a jazzy detective movie soundtrack. I may be guilty of having some personal bias towards track nine, otherwise known as “Sarah Smiles,” purely because I share the same name as the girl it was written for. In this piece, we’re revisited by the previously used Latin inspiration and it sounds like a full Mariachi band is playing along with the upbeat polka-y love song. The verse is bumpy and a nice contrast to the smooth chorus, but the best part of the song is the bridge. It’s filled with passionate and desperate vocals as it builds up to a stop, a beautiful acapella line “Sarah smiles like Sarah doesn’t care.”</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">Urie’s voice is so powerful and pure and perfectly showcased during that moment due to the lack of any instrumental accompaniment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The first time I heard “Nearly Witches” I think my soul left my body and I probably started a whole new phase of existence. The moment the song starts, I know it’s going to be something special. The sample of a teacher conducting her students to sing in French is unique and a soft contrast to the beginning guitar riff&#8211;a staccato, dancey beat. The lyrics of the verse make no sense, maybe because it was partially written by ex-lyricist Ryan Ross, or maybe just because it’s a Panic! At The Disco song. It builds to a chorus that hits me like a brick: “Ever since we met, I only shoot up with your perfume. It’s the only thing that makes me feel as good as you do.”</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">It’s big, it’s grand, it’s dramatic, and it’s glorious. But quickly it’s gone and the song falls into a verse or a bridge. Whatever it is, it’s cool and weird. A vocal impression of that dancey guitar riff that’s ever-present in the masterpiece. After a few more choruses, the song falls into a nod towards the first track, “The Ballad Of Mona Lisa” with a chorus singing “Mona Lisa, pleased to meet ya”</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">and the album ends with a cinematic decrescendo, leaving me with the impression that I’ve just completed some epic journey. Maybe that’s how Brendon Urie and his only fellow member Spencer Smith felt, too.</span></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7841/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7841/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=7841&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>When listening to newly released music from an artist or band you have grown so fond of, you never know what to expect until you give the album a full play through. From someone who listens to Art of Dying religiously their newly released album, <em>Rise Up</em>, is very different from the first album&#8211;different in a very good way. Their sound has not only matured, but Jonny’s vocals are even more raw.</p>
<p>The lyrics of title track “Rise Up” will hit you right in the feels. Jonny sings and yells above jagged riffs, about the haters and hard times that are dragging him down, that they won’t touch him without a fight. With lyrics like “Rise up, take my life back. Rise up, ‘cause I know where I wanna be. I’m done being victimized, sick of being paralyzed. Rise up, cut away the past, take my life back.” Powerful lyrics that focus on never giving up no matter how hard life gets.</p>
<p>The fifth track on the album, “Dead Man Walking,” is about being noticed and wanted in society. Lyrics about loneliness include “Why the hell am I still here? Feels like I could disappear, and if I did would anybody notice?” Millions can relate to this song about not feeling like they belong in society. To find a place where one’s self belongs might be the toughest journey of all.</p>
<p>Seventh track on the album and my personal favorite is called “Everything.” A slower, beautiful, yet a heart wrenching song. The song is written about someone help near and dear to the heart.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>“I won’t give up until this feeling is over. I’ve had enough of drinking myself sober. I really want to let you know, I never want to let you go. This love is keeping me alive. When push comes to shove, will we survive. Is there enough when you look into my eyes. All I want is everything.” </em></p>
<p>Another one of those songs that so many can relate to. When all you want is everything with that one person who holds your heart in their hand. I can only imagine the heartbreak that this song has sung about.</p>
<p>Art of Dying did a great job on <em>Rise Up </em>telling stories through their lyrics. This album is spectacular piece of art that individuals who enjoy harder rock would thoroughly enjoy. I’m going to give this album a 10/10 because I was blown away by each song. Even though the wait for new music was treacherous, it was well worth it.</p>
<p>Track List:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Won’t Do</li>
<li>Rise UP</li>
<li>Tear Down The Wall</li>
<li>Eat You Alive</li>
<li>Dead Man Walking</li>
<li>Some Things Never Change</li>
<li>Everything</li>
<li>Space</li>
<li>Raging</li>
<li>Just For Me</li>
<li>One Day At A Time</li>
<li>Moth To Flame</li>
<li>Ubuntu</li>

		<description><![CDATA[by Jordan Narloch Limitless is Tonight Alive going through an identity crisis and coming out strongly on the other side. “Don’t come looking for me, I don’t wanna be found. I just wanna run away and learn to be free,” Jenna McDougall sings on the opening track. This is an apparent declaration that this album is not going to fit your expectations, and that’s exactly how the band wants it to be. After falling in love with the band after their energetic punk-influenced set three years ago, I expected Limitless to bring back nostalgic memories. Instead, I discovered a new band. No less talented, but a different one by the same name, possibly influenced by McDougall’s recent obsession with Alanis Morissette. The new record is a pop record, whether you like it or not. Rather than keeping the trend of writing songs that melt your mind with their intricate guitars or make you air-drum on your way to class, the band focuses on writing melodies to get stuck in your brain. If you are searching for something somewhat familiar, “To Be Free,” and “How Does It Feel,” are going to be your best bets. Although filled heavily with electronics, guitars [...]<img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=7588&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>

<p>The new record is a pop record, whether you like it or not. Rather than keeping the trend of writing songs that melt your mind with their intricate guitars or make you air-drum on your way to class, the band focuses on writing melodies to get stuck in your brain. If you are searching for something somewhat familiar, “To Be Free,” and “How Does It Feel,” are going to be your best bets. Although filled heavily with electronics, guitars are still the driving force. Aside from those two, the album largely shifts the focus over to electronic production. For example, “Drive” is the perfect song to blast at your summer gatherings with its heavy synth lines and sunny overtones. The real shift in focus however, is to McDougall’s vocals, which shine more than ever. “Oxygen,” and “Human Interaction,” showcase her range while carrying on with the one thing that remains truly familiar about the album, the overwhelming positivity. The latter track comes from a dark place, but ends with a line destined for tattoos and passionate sing-alongs, “But I will be better…” The album is empowering as ever and although it may come off as cheesy in places (“Power of One”) it is perfect for getting anyone through a tough time.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <em>Limitless</em> doesn’t sound like Tonight Alive but it at least feels like them, a similarity missed by other acts that have transitioned to the mainstream, such as Fall Out Boy. They stay focused on the core message they aim to project, but do with so with a “less is more” attitude. <em>Limitless </em>is a well-produced pop record that breaks the mold. Whether they broke into the right territory is for you to decide, but it would be hard to discourage the band’s bright sense of enthusiasm about the new direction.</p>

<p>Here they are our song by song reviews of The 1975&#8217;s latest, <em>I Like It When You Sleep, For You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware Of It.</em></p>
<p><strong>“Change of Heart”</strong></p>
<p>If I were to choose one word to encapsulate the album it would be &#8220;self-aware.&#8221; This time around Matty Healy and the boys deal with the repercussions of their successful debut three years ago. They struggle with fame, loss, materialism, relationships, and drug abuse. Sounds pretty typical for one of the biggest rock/pop bands out there, right? The 1975 take the topics to new dimensions, however, as they address the critics and get introspective on songs like, “A Change of Heart.” The self-referential lines are enough to make fans obsess, but what’s more is that it makes you think. While being cryptic, the song makes you wonder if they were disappointed in the romanticized rock star life, or if the so-called “superficiality” they are often criticized for is more real and tangible than in a typical one. “You said I’m full of diseases. Your eyes were full of regret and then you took a picture of your salad and put it on the Internet,” Healy sings. It’s hard to know for sure where their thoughts lie but that’s the beauty of it. The album is riddled with enough lines of the sort to make you ponder their intentions and even life’s questions, drawing you in whether you like it or not. Pair this with a somber synth-driven sound that once again alters your perception of the lyrics and you get a song that is The 1975 at their finest. -Jordan</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>“This Must Be My Dream”</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“This Must Be My Dream” is the poppiest song on the album, and has been widely considered a favorite by fans so far. The song has every element a good indie-pop song should have: a catchy, repetitive chorus, dreamy imagery, lots of quotable lyrics, and hints at both the ups and downs of any relationship. “This Must Be My Dream” asks the question that reflects the mindset of the whole album: “What does all our love amount to?” The 1975 have shown they have evolved and become wiser through the recklessly naive experiences and relationships they alluded to in their first album. Plus, it’s just a fun song. It’s the kind you can listen to it anywhere: in the car, dancing shamelessly with your friends, dancing all alone in your room. If there’s only one song you listen to off The 1975’s new album, it should be this one. -Lizzie</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Somebody Else&#8221; and &#8220;The Sound&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s hard to choose a favorite song out of the 17 tracks from British indie-rock band The 1975’s </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">I Like it When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">. The electropop, 80s dance party that is the group’s second, and latest, release is purposely flashy and in-your-face. The songs all seem to run together, but in a way that would keep you dancing at a rave somewhere, not bored and turning it down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Somebody Else” is heartbreakingly honest and illustrates an unembellished message of not wanting someone, yet not wanting them to move on. “I don’t want your body, but I hate to think about you with somebody else.” It’s melodically fluid and while the subject matter may be something that slows you down enough for </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">someone</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> to come to mind, it doesn’t stray too far away from the neon lights and flash mob mentality that come from the rest of the record.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“The Sound” was another standout to me. Released recently as a single, the song’s catchy introduction builds with distorted choral pitches singing the hookline, “Well I know when you’re around ‘cause I know the sound, I know the sound of your heart,” before it pushes out into a more expansive reality (whatever “reality” is on this record) and full on dance mode for the next 4 minutes and 9 seconds. -Maddy</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>“Lostmyhead” and “The Ballad of Me and My Brain”</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">One of the best things about The 1975 is that at times it&#8217;s hard to tell when one song has ended and the next has begun. There&#8217;s a special sort of flow when it comes to The 1975, a kind of uninterrupted feeling making it easy to accidentally listen to the entire album without noticing. That soaring ambient sound (thanks to drummer/producer extraordinaire George Daniel) is stronger than ever in &#8220;Lostmyhead.&#8221; On second thought it might seem a little out of place amidst the overall 80s pop sound of the album, but when you learn it&#8217;s actually </span><a href="http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/the-1975s-singer-matt-healy-wrestles-addiction-and-fame-for-the-bands-acclaimed-second-album/news-story/3ba1fd1a004d16bfa7841cde373939ee"><span style="font-weight:400;">the very first 1975 song</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, it&#8217;s no surprise that you didn&#8217;t question it the first time around. The </span><a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2mrv1j"><span style="font-weight:400;">demo</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> of this song, written in 2011, was later incorporated into &#8220;</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7JE5LsDcCY"><span style="font-weight:400;">Facedown</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;, and from there &#8220;Lostmyhead&#8221; picks up. Even though the melody itself is five years old, the lyrics still ring true, especially taking into context the band&#8217;s past two years. Recently, singer Matty Healy has come out about the struggles of constant touring and how he felt like he&#8217;d become an idea more than a person&#8211;an unequivocal reason behind their fresh start. &#8220;The Ballad of Me and My Brain&#8221; pulls that thread of Healy&#8217;s and the band&#8217;s state of mind, a prevalent theme throughout the album. Although this song goes into more detail with the actual circumstances of his struggles, it&#8217;s still a deeper look into what has happened in the time since their first album. Healy is still searching for his lost mind, and he might be searching for another five years, but we can only hope this clean slate helps and shows that no matter what, they&#8217;re still The 1975. -Elizabeth</span></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7601/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7601/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=7601&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>After missing the opening band, I was able to catch the set of Vinyl Theatre’s co-headliners, Finish Ticket, on the <em>Ones to Watch </em>tour at the Triple Rock. Gaining little familiarity any of their songs beforehand left me unsure of what to expect and maybe I’m still not fully sure what a Finish Ticket show is like. Their singer promptly announced after the first song that six straight days of shows took a toll on everyone’s bodies. Despite the sickness, I was pleased to see them run around stage acting like they still had some energy for the opening track, “Wrong.” The rest of their set became a bit mellower, even during songs like, “When Night Becomes Day,” as they were clearly focused on delivering an impressive night musically, if they couldn’t quite manage their usual antics. In the end, the combination of the band’s determination and cover of The Killers’, “When You Were Young,” made for an enjoyable set.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of Vinyl Theatre opened their set with an intro that simply announced they were here to play a show, a nostalgic ode to their label-mate’s “We’re So Starving” (Panic! At The Disco). The intro’s peculiarity was made even more unusual by the blue haired-singer’s (Keegan Calmes) absence. Shortly after, the track picked itself up and Calmes entered with sporadic, over exaggerated jerks as he belted out the notes. Impressive, but I soon noticed a pattern emerging in the movements, making everything feel a little too rehearsed. The band played their songs expertly, however, especially the drummer, whose particular proficiency was highlighted on “Shine On.”</p>
<p>Despite the overall sound of the band being refined to a level many of us could only wish to achieve, the quality of the performance was limited by the band’s three-piece construction. Vinyl Theatre’s songs are complex; just listen to “If You Say So” or “Shaking In The Dead Of Night.” They incorporate multiple synthesizer melodies, bass lines, and occasionally extra guitar parts&#8211;things that are impossible to recreate live without relying heavily on prerecorded pieces. Though there are difficulties in playing with a click track, it didn’t strike me as a wholly live performance for this reason. Everything seemed premeditated and for show, leaving the complexities to the computers. The band did break this robotic mold for a few moments, reminding us of their humanity when they cracked Nickelback jokes and brought their friends from Finish Ticket to share the stage for a cover of Third Eye Blind’s classic, “Jumper.”</p>
<p>As predicted, “Breaking Up My Bones” was the overarching highlight. Everyone in the Triple Rock’s limited space was off of their feet with hands in the air. A scene perfect for a promotional video exemplifying what an alternative pop show looks like. Aside from the exquisite moments in “Breaking Up My Bones,” and the “Jumper” cover, Vinyl Theatre gave an unfortunately average performance. Ultimately, the band did not quite prove to be as memorable as hoped after hearing their excellent studio work.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7647/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7647/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=7647&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">On Saturday, March 5 I attended “An Evening with Grayson DeWolfe” at the Nether Bar, featuring openers Spencer Grimes of Whosah and Josh Clutter. I was happy to be back in the small venue below Mill City Nights for an intimate show, surrounded by friends old and new.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Spencer Grimes is the frontman of local “personal pop” band Whosah. I’m used to seeing him bouncing around a stage with his bandmates to electric guitars and synthesizers&#8211;therefore, the acoustic setting was quite different. Grimes opened with the first track of their </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s Not Just Me In Here </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">EP, “Oxygen.” Spencer’s guitar skills were very impressive for someone who usually isn’t required to play guitar&#8211;he played with such passion that I’m surprised he didn’t break any strings. The Whosah songs translated fantastically to acoustic. The musician was calmer than usual, but not boring, and equally as enthusiastic. He commented on this, stating that he was “In no danger of breaking (his) foot tonight.” You could tell that the ever-energetic frontman was resisting the urge to dance around the stage. One of my favorite things about the set was watching the young musician’s supportive bandmate sing backup vocals from the crowd, a huge smile on his face. Listening to an acoustic Whosah was just as great as seeing the full band&#8211;like being on a playground during a windy day, as opposed to a sunny one. Different vibes, still a flawless show.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Local singer-songwriter Josh Clutter was next to take the stage with his girlfriend Kailey Johnson and drummer Erik Bear. His music is lovely and relaxing and it reminded me of lazy summer days in bed, the sunlight filtering through the window. Clutter’s voice is strong and pleasant, and his harmonies with Johnson were amazing. It’s obvious that he really means the soulful words he sings&#8211;an important trait of live music. Although his music was serious, he kept up a light atmosphere in the dark room, cracking jokes between songs. It was hysterical to see his friends in the crowd “positively heckling” him&#8211;something I didn’t think existed until grown men were screaming their love to Josh Clutter. After his set ended he was met with well-deserved and thunderous applause.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This show was Grayson DeWolfe’s highly-anticipated first solo gig in over a year. He is usually found performing with his pop/rock band Time Atlas, but they’re currently busy working on new music, so the young musician returned to his solo roots. As DeWolfe’s set started, he was immediately met with a chorus of voices singing along to his 2014 single “Temporary,” a bouncy rock song about the perils of love. The room was instantly transformed into a party, buzzing with energy and a laid-back, feel-good atmosphere. It was all smiles from everyone. Grayson played a mix of his older solo songs and his newer Time Atlas songs, with a slew of pop covers thrown between. Everything was very well-received from the crowd of loyal fans and friends&#8211;there was hardly ever a dull moment. At one point, he let a girl up onstage to sing part of his song for him (and she did very well). At another point, he made the crowd swear an oath to clap along, though I doubt anyone was unwilling. Artist-fan interaction is always important. Grayson DeWolfe is a natural-born performer who commands attention to the stage with his confidence and personality, and always puts on a good show.</span></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7637/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7637/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=7637&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

With his seventh studio album, The Life of Pablo, Kanye West teaches us that there&#8217;s no limits to just how Kanye he can be.

Of course, if you want to answer those questions for yourself, you have two (legal) options: pay ten bucks a month for Tidal or get the first thirty seconds of each song for free on kanyewest.com.

<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;Ultralight Beam&#8221;: As performed it on </span><a href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/kanye-west-ultralight-beam/2985373"><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Saturday Night Live</span></i></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> with a slew of aides (Chance the Rapper and Kelly Price among them), the full version of &#8220;Ultralight Beam&#8221; proves that three parts gospel, two parts rap, and five parts guests apparently yields a song that might just make you want to believe in something.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1&#8221;: Our thirty seconds have no Kanye. Instead, we get an Uncle Murda sample. Today&#8217;s guest artist is Kid Cudi.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;Pt. 2&#8221;: More fast paced and personal than its predecessor, it&#8217;s a Kanye song. </span><a href="http://genius.com/8666615"><span style="font-weight:400;">Genius.com</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> notes that, &#8220;After his mom died, the chopped up soul samples we heard predominately on his first three albums disappeared,&#8221; which is touching considering the album so far.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;Famous&#8221;: Including the infamous Taylor Swift line and dropped originally at the Yeezy Season 3 release, Rihanna plays fame seducing and ultimately losing Kanye.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;Feedback&#8221;: An (but probably not </span><span style="font-weight:400;">the</span><span style="font-weight:400;">) explanation as to who Pablo is, this clip has a reference to Escobar, the Colombian drug lord. That pretty much sums it up: Kanye spends our 30 seconds together both dismissing his money and flaunting it.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;Low Lights&#8221;: Basically the a capella version of &#8220;So Alive&#8221; by Kings of Tomorrow, there&#8217;s some bonus some instrumental backing behind the uncredited woman&#8217;s biblical testimonial.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;Highlights&#8221;: In contrast with the previous song, this album&#8217;s interlude, &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><a href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/kanye-west-highlights/2985364">Highlights</a>&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> is a summary of Ye&#8217;s career in both the recording studio and the bedroom. Apparently. The thirty seconds only get you through Kanye and Young Thug repeating that, &#8220;we only makin&#8217; the highlights.&#8221; It&#8217;s nice to know Kanye still loves his mama, though.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;Freestyle 4&#8221;: Rap God Kanye comes back to team up with Wasted Kanye and Lustful Kanye within his own mind. Yeah, it&#8217;s weird.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;I Love Kanye&#8221;: You know when you say a word over and over and it stops sounding like a word? That&#8217;s what this does to &#8220;Kanye.&#8221; Despite (or perhaps because of) that, it&#8217;s one of the best, most honest tracks on the album. The best lyrics? Not really. The best production? There isn&#8217;t really any. The best music? It&#8217;s a capella. But it&#8217;s Kanye, to Kanye, </span><a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2299136/kanye-west-autographed-photo/"><span style="font-weight:400;">love Kanye</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;Waves&#8221;: Personally, I&#8217;m tired of having to listen and pay attention to Chris Brown, and it&#8217;s a little disappointing that one of the best lines on the album is in his voice: &#8220;Waves don&#8217;t die / Let me crash here for the moment.&#8221;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;FML&#8221;: &#8230;which actually means &#8220;for my lady.&#8221; The only disappointing part of this one is the fact that you miss out on the three minutes that presumably have The Weeknd in them.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;Real Friends&#8221;: What revived 2010&#8217;s &#8220;G.O.O.D. Fridays&#8221; series, this was originally put on Soundcloud in January (and then taken down and put back up and taken down again) before eventually ending up on the album.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;Wolves&#8221;: This was the Yeezy Season 1 release soundtrack, but apparently even the changes made in the year since still aren&#8217;t enough as Kanye plans to </span><a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/698971890581401600"><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;fix&#8221; it</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;Siiiiiiiiilver Surffffeeeeer Intermission&#8221;: Literally all talk. Wiz Khalifa&#8217;s quasi-drama in defence of Max B from way back when the album was still </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Waves </span><span style="font-weight:400;">is settled by this message left on Kanye&#8217;s answering machine from him and French Montana, giving Kanye the permission and blessing to keep &#8220;doing you, doing your wave.&#8221;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;30 Hours&#8221;: Tab through your pages of kanyewest.com, genius.com, a maybe a wikipedia.org or two to find yourself on </span><a href="https://soundcloud.com/kanyewest/30-hours"><span style="font-weight:400;">Soundcloud</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> for the entirety of this one. Of all the tracks that could exist outside of Tidal, it wouldn&#8217;t be a first choice, but a self-aware Kanye is always a welcome Kanye. Would that it only had the new addition of Andre 3000 on it.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;No More Parties in LA&#8221;: Staying on </span><a href="https://soundcloud.com/kanyewest/nomorepartiesinla"><span style="font-weight:400;">Soundcloud</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> a little while longer, this collaboration of hip hop heavyweights consists of even more of Kanye and now Kendrick&#8217;s frustrations with the rich and famous around him in LA, despite the fact that he&#8217;s kinda, you know, one of them. Written in the midst of </span><span style="font-weight:400;">My Dark Twisted Fantasy </span><span style="font-weight:400;">and calling back to </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Late Registration</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, it&#8217;s the Kanye we know, love, and are somewhat annoyed by.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;Facts (Charlie Heat Version)&#8221;: A song about how Adidas Yeezys do better than Nikes? The non-Charlie Heat rough draft is </span><a href="https://soundcloud.com/kanyewest/facts-explicit"><span style="font-weight:400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8220;Fade&#8221;: And, to complete the trilogy, the Yeezy Season 2 hype song. In stark contrast to the opening, &#8220;Fade&#8221; is funky, more reminiscent of </span><span style="font-weight:400;">808s &amp; Heartbreak</span><span style="font-weight:400;">. It doesn&#8217;t bring the album full circle so much as it drops you off in the middle of nowhere just as you realize you haven&#8217;t been paying attention to the street signs.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Is nine out of fifty-eight-and-change minutes enough to make a good judgement call on an entire album? Probably not. There&#8217;s a lot missing out that could make or break the album, but we can only ever work with what we have. In this case, that&#8217;s 15.5% of the music and 100% of the dramatic circumstances of the album&#8217;s release, and therein lies the problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">With the fog surrounding the release of </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Pablo</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, distinguishing opinions about the music from those about the people, or even just the surprise/relief that it&#8217;s out, is difficult. Even those who have heard the entirety of the album find themselves asking if they would have liked it as much without the drama, and those of us who haven&#8217;t had that privilege are at a loss of what to say. Not to mention your thoughts about Tidal and their ethic, we can all agree on one thing: It&#8217;s hard not to be disappointed when you can&#8217;t hear the music you want to, especially coming from an artist such as Kanye West. For someone who preaches constantly about how important making art for the sake of art is, Kanye doesn&#8217;t seem very interested it letting everyone engage with that very thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But, of course, it wouldn&#8217;t be Kanye if there weren&#8217;t any complications or reservations, a fact that he seems well aware of. In &#8220;I Love Kanye,&#8221; he addresses the very thing:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="font-weight:400;">What if Kanye made a song, about Kanye?</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="font-weight:400;">Called &#8220;i miss the old kanye,&#8221; man that would be so Kanye</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="font-weight:400;">That&#8217;s all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="font-weight:400;">and I love you like Kanye loves Kanye</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The degree of cognizance that Kanye has for himself is admirable, if at times excessive, but this song really solidifies the idea that Kanye is Kanye, and if you like that, you&#8217;ll like this. Especially when you think about it outside of the circumstances of the release, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Pablo</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> only makes sense at some level of self-awareness, at the point where you can joke about how Kanye it is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In the end, your opinion of the album hinges on three things: if you can listen to the whole thing, if you care about drama, and if you can separate the artist from the man. If you&#8217;re a fan of Kanye enough to have Tidal and thrive on drama, you&#8217;re probably in pretty good shape to listen to </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">The Life of Pablo </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">over and over for the next month. If you aren&#8217;t, maybe it isn&#8217;t worth your time. The good news is, regardless of your opinion of </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">this </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">album, there&#8217;s always </span><a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/702566224304152576"><span style="font-weight:400;">the next one</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7384/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7384/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=7384&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
