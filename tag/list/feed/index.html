<p><strong>Punk Reunions</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">2015 was full of surprises, like Underoath announcing their reunion tour after releasing a video saying that they&#8217;d never play together again. If something like this could happen, who&#8217;s to say Blink 182 or My Chemical Romance won&#8217;t get back together? 2016 will be a year of new beginnings for the punk and alt-rock music scenes. -Cassie</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Sky is Falling</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In 2016 more bands members will leave their bands. Bands will change their sound and their fans will complain into the abyss we call the internet. We’ll make a fuss because there aren’t any “good” bands that play Warped Tour. And we’ll say the “scene” is dead when it really isn’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Music will always continue to change and grow. And plenty of awesome bands still play Warped. But over the years our tastes change and so does the demand of “fresh” music. Sometimes we forget that. -Hana Simons</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Shark Tale!</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">2015 was the year of Left Shark, Katy Perry’s blue Super Bowl companion. His dance moves were awkward and his gaping toothy smile was charming. He stole the heart of every football fan in America. But what ever happened to his under appreciated companion, Right Shark?  Right Shark is probably sitting at home on his couch, eating a bag of chips, wondering the same thing. He is also probably planning his comeback. 2016 will be the year of Right Shark, even if I have to make it so. Watch out for him, Coldplay and Kevin Jonas at Super Bowl 50 this year.  Right Shark’s amazing dance moves and creativity will not go unnoticed again. -Sararosa Davies</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1D + JoBros =❤</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The day that One Direction announced Zayn was leaving will undoubtedly go down in history as the day the universe fell apart. But contrary to the majority of the population, I’m less concerned about Zayn’s future endeavors than I am about the fate of his former bandmates. Will the group remain a quartet, or are they going to recruit another member in 2016? The possibility is high, so the only question is, who will the new member of One Direction be? So many people would be great: Ezra Koenig, Dan from Bastille, a golden retriever puppy. But the real winner would undoubtedly be Kevin Jonas. Maybe what the 1D lads need is someone with previous boyband experience, and who better to replace bad-boy Zayn than lovable Kevin? By far the most underrated member of the JoBros, Kevin finally deserves his own time to shine, and maybe 2016 will be his year. -Lizzie</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Take it to the Cloud</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">2016 is the year Soundcloud takes over as the most popular music streaming website. How amazing would it be to stream the newest One Direction single on the same site where you could listen to your 12-year-old cousin’s iPhone recorded mixtape? -Maddy Siiter</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hello? It&#8217;s me.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">On her huge North American summer tour, Adele will bring out various famous music acts to join her and do it better than Taylor Swift. It won&#8217;t be every night, in an effort to keep up the usual Adele mystique, but they will be there. Look forward to Alicia Keys, Sam Smith, and Sia randomly gracing stages near you. But still no Frank Ocean album. -Elizabeth Coleman</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Too Many Choices</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Looking back on music in 2015, I tend to notice how easily the term synthpop is applied to the more popular tunes. With bands like Walk The Moon, Fitz and the Tantrums, BØRNS, and the dream pop act Beach House, some 80s vibes are definitely prevalent. This can obviously only lead to one thing in 2016: Disco Revival. It only makes sense! We just boogie backwards from here. I think we can all collectively look forward to some sick roller rink tracks in the months ahead. Can you dig it?</span></p>
<p><em>OR&#8230;</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">On January 1st, 2016, Vampire Weekend frontman and resident Twitter King Ezra Koenig typed out a paramount tweet: “2016: vampire weekend &amp; getting jacked (or shredded).” The first half of this tweet is obviously exciting for VW fans with a possible promise of new music, but the latter half leaves questions to be asked. I have my own theory to offer: Vampire Weekend’s much anticipated fourth album is going to be a musical accompaniment to an interactive workout video. Ezra Koenig will help you get “jacked” in the energetic, sweatband-filled instructional in a Richard Simmons-esque manner. Twenty jumping jacks per Cape Cod reference! -Sarah Bel</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s Go Back to &#8217;96! (1896)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In recent years, hipsters everywhere have been attempting to return to recorded music’s roots by instigating a vinyl revival. Well in 2016, Arcade Fire will decide to follow up their latest album, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Reflektor</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, and release it exclusively on phonograph cylinders. The technology, first used in 1896, will spread like wildfire due to the indie album’s popularity and become the medium of choice for those trying to get back to the “good ol’ days.” If I were you, I’d swap out that turntable you just got for a new mechanical cylinder phonograph as soon as possible. Think of the endless bragging rights you will have when you are sitting at your desk listening to that first Arcade Fire pressing, sipping your fair-trade coffee, and reading the cylinder’s box sleeve for the for the album notes before any of your friends. &#8211; Jordan Narloch</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fraggle Rock</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Ben Folds Five releases a new album, finally. The band reformed in 2011 yet their last release was in 2013 and we simply can’t take it anymore. At this point, withdrawals are so bad, we would take a full album that features the Fraggles, echoing their “Do It Anyway” video from 2012. Actually, this album would be encouraged. -Ryan</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FINALLY</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In 2016, Pierce The Veil will FINALLY release a new album and that’s all that really matters this year. -Sara Dollens</span></p>

<p>Our staff got together and wrote about our favorite albums of the year. Take a look! Do you agree? What are we missing?</p>
<p>Now, in no particular order:</p>
<h3>The Best Albums of 2015</h3>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Fi4T-yR8tM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><b><em>twelvefour</em> &#8211; The Paper Kites</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I’ll be honest: I’m not a huge fan of the Paper Kites’ first album. Don’t get me wrong, the songs are pretty. But they’re boring to listen to, and will never compare to the brilliance of 2011’s </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Woodland</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> EP. Despite my repeated efforts, I could never muster the patience to get through </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">States</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">. Because of this, when the group’s sophomore full-length, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">twelvefour</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, was released in August, I was hesitant to listen to it. Would it live up to my expectations, or even my hopes? Regardless of my doubt, I gave it a try, and thank god I did. Titled &#8220;<em>twelvefour</em>&#8221; because all the songs were written between 12 and 4 a.m., the album is vastly different atmospherically than anything the band has done before. While their old music sounds like meadows and sunny mornings, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">twelvefour</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> sounds like nighttime in the city; neon lights, tall buildings, and the freedom of anonymity, youth, and love. Perhaps my favorite illustration of this feeling is through the song “Revelator Eyes,” a hypnotic single that sounds like it belongs on the soundtrack to every cliche movie ever made. And the best part about it: the music video was filmed entirely in Minneapolis. Other highlights of the album include “Electric Indigo” and “Neon Crimson.” &#8211;<a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/lizzie/">Lizzie</a></span></p>

<p><strong><em>Glitterbug</em> &#8211; The Wombats</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The wait for a new record from The Wombats was a long one, starting with the release of &#8220;Your Body Is a Weapon&#8221; in October of 2013, but it was well worth it when we finally got </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Glitterbug </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">this April. Full of clever lyrics and pure, solid indie rock, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Glitterbug</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> makes you listen to it on repeat until you have nothing left to dance away, and quite a few have spent the past eight months doing so. Like &#8220;Greek Tragedy&#8221; says, &#8220;smashing mics in karaoke bars&#8221; is one thing you&#8217;ll find yourself doing, if only in a metaphorical sense, and you&#8217;ll enjoy it every step of the way. For those who were afraid the four year gap would change them irrevocably: don&#8217;t worry, The Wombats are as weird and relatable as ever, and we&#8217;re glad to have them back. &#8211;<a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/elizabeth/">Elizabeth Coleman</a></span></p>

<p><strong><em>Node</em> &#8211; Northlane</strong></p>
<p>I made a goal for myself this year and that was to listen to as many new artists as possible. Earlier in the year, I came across an Australian metalcore band known as Northlane. I searched them up and listened to a few songs. I liked their sound, but for some reason I didn’t really listen to them after that. A few days ago I was listening to the band, Beartooth, on YouTube and a song from Northlane’s newest album, <em>Node</em>, which was released back on July 24, popped up on the recommended section. I decided to listen to their album from start to finish and boy was I surprised. The album starts with the song &#8220;Soma.&#8221; What essentially drew me into the song were the drums. For some reason, they sounded a lot more pronounced and unique than some of the other bands I listen to. As I continued listening through the album, I was more surprised with each song that played. When I heard their sixth song, &#8220;Rot,&#8221; within the first 20 seconds it became my new favorite song. Each song is unique and stands out on its own. Nothing sounds the same. I love music that you randomly find and fall in love with. I listened to a ton of killer albums this year, but for me, “Node” stood out the most and I’m so thankful I finally gave them a proper listen. &#8211;<a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/sara/">Sara Dollens</a></p>

<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fdXNNveYOfU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><strong><em>Blue Neighbourhood</em> &#8211; Troye Sivan</strong></p>
<p><em>Blue Neighbourhood</em> is Troye’s own version of EDM, bringing the very sexuality and personality of his voice. Throughout the album you hear that painful honesty and truth that Troye puts into his lyrics. Like the lyrics in the song “Lost Boy” he sings, “I’m just some dumb kid trying to kid myself  that I got my shit together.” This is where his lyrics mean something to him and shows his personality. With this Troye’s music can be relatable to most teens today. The album starts off with the song titled “Wild” featuring these kids shouting “Hey!” and “Wild.” I think this starts off the album really well. “Bite” which is another song off of his <em>Wild</em> EP brings this spine tingling beginning and this is where Troye’s sexual side shows. In the end, <em>Blue Neighbourhood</em> is definitely an album you should listen to. &#8211;<a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/taylor/">Taylor</a></p>

<div><strong><i>Sometimes I Sit and Think and Sometimes I Just Sit</i> &#8211; Courtney Barnett</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Sometimes I Sit and Think and Sometimes I Just Sit </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">by Australian indie-rocker Courtney Barnett is an album for transitions in all their confusion and excitement. The album came out in March of last year and has stayed with me through senior fall. Slower tracks like “Depreston” have accompanied me on my journey from the eternal angst of college applications to the pleasant comfort in acceptances and all the way back again. I have thrashed to the fuzzy guitar riffs of “Nobody Cares if You Don’t Go the Party” on many Friday nights when I don’t want to go anywhere else but my room. Barnett’s lyrics have this rebellion to them in the way they portray everyday occurrences. Just look at these from opening song, “Elevator Operator, “Oliver Paul, twenty years old/ Thick head of hair worries he&#8217;s going bald/Wakes up at a quarter past nine/Fare evades his way down the 96 tram line.” I know I am only 17 and I’m not going bald, but I definitely &#8220;feel&#8221; Courtney Barnett’s lyrics especially as the semester ends. After all, teenage angst doesn’t end when you get out of high school, it just transforms. Thanks to this album I’m ready to take on all of the angst 2016 has to bring, whatever that may be. &#8211;<a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/sararosa/">Sararosa Davies</a></span></p>

<p><strong><em>Copacetic</em> &#8211; Knuckle Puck</strong></p>
<div>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;"><em>Copacetic</em> is the embodiment of flannels shirts, pizza, Vans, and sad boys. Which makes this one of the best albums of 2015. Knuckle Puck makes you confront things that you normally would push aside. Everything could be falling down but you pretend that everything is in its place. Most people do this without realizing it. <em>Copacetic</em> makes you yell along with the lyrics, jump into a crowd of people who feel the same emotions as you. It sets you free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I’ve been fraying at the fabric// Strung out and biting on the back of my bottom lip// I’ll tell you everything is copacetic” </span></p>

<p><strong><i>Psychic Reader</i> &#8211; Bad Bad Hats</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Minneapolis-based indie-pop band, Bad Bad Hats, released their debut record </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Psychic Reader </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">this past summer and even though I only discovered it over the past few months, it’s easily one of my favorite albums of 2015.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I can’t pinpoint what songs from the 10-track record specifically zero in on both lead-vocalist Kerry Alexander’s soft and simple vocals and the catchy, very poetic, indie lyrics together. The whole record does that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I really do love every song on this record, but to highlight a few, I’d have to say “Joseph” is one that really grabs my attention. Any time an artist mentions a name in a song, it immediately makes it more interesting, leaving listeners to wonder about the story, especially with this hookline, “I want you to remember, I want you to forget about me.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Things We Never Say” is a little more mellow, opening with the simple strum of an acoustic guitar. Alexander’s simple vocals echo through this track, “I can’t get you off my mind babe, so I bought this dress to spite you.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I haven’t been a long time fan of this fairly new band, but I felt automatically connected and relaxed when I listened to </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Psychic Reader</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">. It’s rare for me to feel like I wasn’t listening with new ears when I really was, but I’m glad it got to be Bad Bad Hats. &#8211;<a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/maddy/">Maddy Siiter</a></span></p>

<p><strong><em>Indulgence: A Saga Of Lights</em> &#8211; SycAmour</strong></p>
<p><em>Indulgence: A Saga Of Lights</em> by SycAmour is one of the most incredible albums of 2015. It has followed me since it was released and I haven’t been able to get enough of them. Their music sort of lives through me. Their lyrics are great storytelling and show their love of what they do. To express your life and wisdom takes a lot of talent and thought.</p>
<p>If you haven’t listened to them, I would not yet advise judging them based off of who they have toured with or what record label they are signed to. SycAmour does a fantastic job putting their life into music and lyrics that tug at your heart. Their first single, a well chosen one, &#8220;Calm Down Juliet (What A Drama Queen)&#8221; is a mix of sleazy creativity and prodded emotion. Their second song off of the album revealed to the public, &#8220;We’re In Hell,&#8221; has more of a sway punk vibe to it. The lyrics capture you and express a lot of meaningful emotion, but it wasn’t necessarily the best song to choose for their second single. A better chosen song would have been &#8220;Shut The Fuck Up&#8221; simply because people would be amped up a little more. Their third single release was &#8220;Composure&#8221; (featuring Trenton Woodley from Hands Like Houses), which is probably one their best songs on the album. With Jeremy Gilmore’s strong almost angelic vocals and Tony Sugent’s powerful screams, they created and album that’s more than worthy to listen to. <em>Give Indulgence: A Saga Of Lights</em> a listen if you have not yet done so. &#8211;<a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/genna/">Genna Skouge</a></p>

<p><strong><em>American Candy</em> – The Maine</strong></p>
<p>2015 brought with it the triumphant return of The Maine, and boy was it sweet. With <em>American Candy</em>, the Arizona alt-rockers increased their charmingly independent attitude to craft one of their most enthused, genuine albums thus far. <em>American Candy </em>is filled with licks of grounded, dancey pop tunes (“Same Suit, Different Tie”), 90s-esque pop rock (“English Girls”), and catchy songs about growing out your hair just because (“My Hair”). The record is fun, thoughtful, and extremely positive, especially in contrast to the gloomy <em>Forever Halloween</em>. If you check out one record from 2015 or even The Maine, let it be this one. –<a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/jordan/">Jordan Narloch</a></p>

<p><strong><em>Stay Alive</em> &#8211; Her Echo</strong></p>
<p>It’s not very common to hear a band who can keep changing things up with every album, always coming up with something new to keep their music interesting. So when I heard Her Echo’s newest album, <em>Stay Alive</em>, when it was released December 5, I was left speechless. After already being impressed by Her Echo’s last album, <em>Standing Tall</em>, I was expecting a similar reaction to this newest album. I was proven wrong. Her Echo has well surpassed even their last album with tracks like “Safe Harbor” featuring Ryan Kirby of Fit For A King and “Se7ev” featuring Chad Ruhlig from For the Fallen Dreams. After listening to this album, fans will be left in awe of the captivating sound Her Echo has succeeded, once again, in producing. &#8211;<a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/cassie/">Cassie</a></p>

It happens to the best of us, and it’s on those days that the importance of finding new music that you haven’t already heard a million times is most clear.

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We all have those days where, despite an overwhelming desire to listen to </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">something</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, the endless number of songs in your music library just isn’t cutting it anymore.

<p><b>5. The Japanese House </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If you’ve listened to this band already, you probably discovered them one of two ways &#8212; either you’re really into British radio, or you’re really into The 1975. Produced by Matty Healy and George Daniel of the aforementioned renowned indie act, The Japanese House is the epitome of chill. Written and co-produced by singer Amber Bain, the music is more electronic than the 1975, but is equally as nostalgic and easy to get lost in. Every track is full, synthy, and sporadic like the waves on the ocean. With a debut EP already under their belts, the band released two excellent new singles last month, Clean and Cool Blue, off the forthcoming EP </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Clean</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">. Advertised almost exclusively through Healy and Daniel, The Japanese House had their debut live performance on BBC Radio 1, and is about to begin a small tour throughout the UK. The EP </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Pools to Bathe In </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">is available on iTunes, Spotify, and </span><a href="https://soundcloud.com/the-japanese-house"><span style="font-weight:400;">Soundcloud</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<div class="embed-soundcloud"><iframe width="940" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F131135569&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=940&#038;maxheight=1000"></iframe></div>
<p><b>4. Marsicans </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Marsicans, a promising 4-piece from northern England, have the type of music I like to refer to as beach pop. With a debut release full of bright, energetic songs, they have a certain air of sophistication and crispness that is rare in really young bands. </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">The Chivalry EP</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> doesn’t sound like it was written by a group of teenagers, but the members are only 21, and formed the band while still in high school. Their sound is quite similar to that of Wild Party, Cheerleader, and hometown favorites Hippo Campus. My personal favorite track is </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Terrapin</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, the short-and-sweet first single off their EP. Check it out along with the rest of their music on </span><a href="https://marsicans.bandcamp.com/"><span style="font-weight:400;">bandcamp</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<div class="embed-soundcloud"><iframe width="940" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F190033500&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=940&#038;maxheight=1000"></iframe></div>
<p><b>3. Future Teens </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Though Gabe Goodman and Daniel Radin are now beyond their teenage years, the former Magic Man bassists and current members of Photocomfort and the Novel Ideas, respectively, couldn’t have picked a more fitting band name. With their basement-demo sound, you’d never guess these guys were in one of the biggest new synthpop bands to emerge last year, and I don’t mean that in a bad way. Their angsty lyrics and pining vocals, though not all that crisp or professional sounding, will get stuck in your head and hit home because let’s be honest: your teenage years are full of angst and suffering. A perfect example of this is their tune “Jennifer Lawrence,” which is possibly the most relatable song about a celebrity crush ever written. Another standout track, “Casual Dating,” is like the quieter, dorky younger brother of “First Date” by Blink-182 (and again, I mean that in the best way possible). It’s like these guys just have a lot of pent up teenage emotions that they never got out when they were actually teenagers, so they’re doing it now. Their debut EP,</span><i><span style="font-weight:400;"> Still Afraid of Allston</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, came out in April, and you can get it on </span><a href="https://soundcloud.com/futureteensofamerica"><span style="font-weight:400;">Soundcloud</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> or stream it on Spotify.</span></p>
<div class="embed-soundcloud"><iframe width="940" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F213672605&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=940&#038;maxheight=1000"></iframe></div>
<p><b>2. Look Out Love </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Dubbed as music for fans of the 1975, Look Out Love has a significantly poppier sound, but definitely follows the same vein. At least, you can clearly hear the 1975’s influence in the vocals, and see it in frontman Jordan Benker’s striking resemblance to Matty Healy. After debuting in 2014 with mini-album </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s 11:11 Somewhere</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, the Chicago-based band released a follow-up EP, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Oh Boy</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, just last month. While they’ve maintained a consistent sound, it’s clear the band has matured both musically and lyrically since </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s 11:11 Somewhere</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, and have proved to be a band to watch out for in the coming year. Their music is available on iTunes and on Spotify.</span></p>
<div class="embed-soundcloud"><iframe width="940" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F213661829&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=940&#038;maxheight=1000"></iframe></div>
<p><b>1. Lux Lisbon </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Lux Lisbon have the type of music you want to fall in love to. Perfectly crafted rock/pop reminiscent of The Killers and Florence and the Machine, their songs are easy to dance to, cry to, and feel alive to. Their lyrics are effortlessly cinematic and poetic, revolving primarily around the wild, stupid, triumphant carelessness of youth and young love. Outstanding songs include “Bullingdon Club” and “Your Heart Is a Weapon the Size of Your Fist.” If there’s one band off this list that you decide to listen to, it should be this one, and you can even download their 11-track extended EP for free right </span><a href="http://luxlisbon.com/free"><span style="font-weight:400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/5793/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/5793/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=5793&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fall is a time of change and new beginnings&#8211;shorter days, crunchy leaves, colder air, and of course, a new academic year. Some people love it, some hate it, but regardless of how you feel it&#8217;s a million times better than the bitter winter we all know is coming. Here&#8217;s a playlist to help you enjoy the beautiful weather, and survive returning back to school.</span></p>
<div class="embed-spotify"><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:garagemusicnews:playlist:68JSCnMIDFoOf6uRogeq5b" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>&#8220;Castle&#8221; &#8212; Halsey</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This song is the perfect way to motivate yourself to start waking up painfully early in the morning. School? Bring it on.</span></p>
<p><strong>“Spin” &#8212; Bad Bad Hats</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This song sounds like the opening song in a crappy high school romantic comedy. And I mean that in the best way possible. So why not listen to it to make the first day back a little less dull?</span></p>
<p><strong>“So Radio” &#8212; Look Out Love</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Oxford Comma” &#8212; Vampire Weekend</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I don&#8217;t know about you, but I automatically think of this song whenever I walk into English class.</span></p>
<p><strong>“Ivy and Gold” &#8212; Bombay Bicycle Club</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If the leaves sang as they changed colors, they&#8217;d sing this song.</span></p>
<p><strong>“Souls” &#8212; Hippo Campus</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This is an awesome tune by my favorite MN band, and perfect in those last few weeks of being outside before it gets REALLY cold.</span></p>
<p><strong>“Wind Fall” &#8212; Photocomfort [Not available on Spotify]</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This song is perfect to listen to while walking through the woods admiring the red and gold trees.</span></p>
<p><strong>“Dreams” &#8212; Bastille feat. Gabrielle Aplin</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leave it to Bastille to cover a Fleetwood Mac song and make it sound dramatic, haunting, and perfect for a cold and rainy fall night.</span></p>
<p><strong>“Weekend” &#8212; Priory</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Even though it&#8217;s back-to-school, we still have the weekends. Beautiful, wonderful weekends.</span></p>
<p><strong>“Anna Sun” &#8212; Walk the Moon</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Singer Nick Petricca once said this song was about his adventures during his college days. It&#8217;s a final celebration of the warmer weather, and a perfect closer to this playlist.</span></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/5515/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/5515/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=5515&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<h4><strong>Icon for Hire</strong></h4>
<p>The music scene seems to be getting flooded with more and more unoriginal music from the same generic bands and it&#8217;s getting difficult to find a decent one-of-a-kind act. However, there is one band that can forever stop your search: Icon For Hire. At last there is a band who has mastered the fine art of creating music people love while still making it their own individual creation. Icon For Hire combines everything anyone could love about music by mixing influences from punk, hardcore, pop, and rock to create something extraordinary. With her bright pink hair and awe-inspiring fashion sense, Ariel kills the stage with her mind-blowing vocals filled with unmatchable passion. Guitarist Shawn Jump also wins the crowd over with his superior guitar shredding and self-designed mohawk that is second to none. Completing this incomparable trio is Adam Kronshagen with his matchless drumming and driving beats. When these three incredible musicians are put together on stage, they create something so breathtaking and unforgettable, you&#8217;ll have to see it for yourself. Out of all the bands on Warped Tour this year, Icon For Hire is definitely not one you want to miss! &#8211;Cassie</p>
<h4><strong>Bebe Rexha</strong></h4>
<p>Bebe Rexha is a familiar voice with a not-so-familiar name. Former frontwoman of Pete Wentz&#8217;s Black Cards, the New York singer has been featured on songs like Cash Cash&#8217;s &#8220;Take Me Home&#8221; and David Guetta and Nicki Minaj&#8217;s &#8220;Hey Mama.&#8221; Having written songs for the likes of Eminem, Selena Gomez, and Madonna, Rexha was signed to Warner Bros. Records and released her first solo EP <i>I Don&#8217;t Wanna Grow Up </i>this past May.</p>
<div>Rexha&#8217;s unique voice translates perfectly from record to stage, clearly cutting through her band&#8217;s drum and guitar. The energy from both her and her band is enthusiastic and consuming, with songs like &#8220;Take Me Home&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;m Gonna Show You Crazy&#8221; lifting the crowd off their feet and dragging them into the experience. It&#8217;s well worth it to spend some of your time at Warped to see Bebe Rexha, a name that soon no one will be able to forget. &#8211;Elizabeth</div>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>Mod Sun</strong></h4>
<div>
<p>This Minnesota native is sure to make you smile with his unique style dubbed “Hippy-Hop.” Mod Sun is all about creating a positive atmosphere by taking you on hip-hop-influenced musical trips to the 1970s. Instead of rapping about the stereotypical subjects of the genre that are based on misogyny, violence, and money, he takes a different approach. In Mod Sun’s world, women deserve the finest and someone will only be shot down if it’s with a peace sign. As far as money goes, he thinks it’s “cool and everything, but [he’d] rather make a memory.” Oh, and did I mention that his set is backed by a live band? Mod Sun is truly a rarity in the hip-hop world. So do yourself a favor this summer and make a memory with him, he will not disappoint. &#8211;Jordan</p>
</div>
<h4><strong>Moose Blood</strong></h4>
<p>Everyone loves a little pop punk in his or her life. That being said, Moose Blood is a must see on this year&#8217;s Warped Tour.  Hailing all the way from Canterbury, England, Moose Blood is a four-piece British band that joined forces back in 2012 through their passion for music. Signed with No Sleep Records, Moose Blood released their debut full-length album, <em>I’ll Keep You In Mind From Time To Time</em> in the fall of 2014 and made their mark in the alternative rock scene. Moose blood takes a twist on their sound through their love of mid 90’s emo, and brings you an alternative pop punk sound like no other.  They’re honest lyrics about life, relationships, friends, and family, draw listeners in wanting more. If you’re looking for some awesome summer tunes, I highly recommend you check out Moose Blood at this year&#8217;s Warped Tour. I promise you won&#8217;t regret it! &#8211;Sara</p>
<h4><strong>Koo Koo Kangaroo</strong></h4>
<p>The last time I saw Koo Koo Kangaroo perform was at the International Cat Video Festival. If that doesn’t say anything about the hip hop duo, what does? They are something else, entirely.</p>
<div>With eclectic gold outfits and hilarious, meme-worthy hip hop, they are a new addition to the Warped Tour lineup (in my mind in place of the wonderful Watsky), but a perfect one nonetheless. Please, please go see this weird group. Look out for popular jams “Cat Party” and “Unibrow.” They are literally the internet incarnate. Enjoy it, cherish it. Party it up. &#8211;Sararosa</div>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>Pvris</strong></h4>
<p>It&#8217;s rare to see a band with a female lead make it big in the alt rock scene, but Pvris are doing just that. Fronted by killer vocalist Lynn Gunn, the band has been quickly gaining momentum since the release of their debut album, <i>White Noise</i>, in the fall of 2014. With stand-out tracks like &#8220;St. Patrick,&#8221; &#8220;Holy,&#8221; and &#8220;Mirrors,&#8221; the album showcases Gunn&#8217;s impressive vocal range, as well as exhibiting definite talent and uniqueness both structurally and lyrically. Gunn&#8217;s vocals are equally as powerful and controlled live, and her efforts to interact with the crowd and get them involved in the show, though standard, are nonetheless effective. This year is Pvris&#8217; debut at Warped Tour, and theirs is a set you won&#8217;t want to miss. &#8211;Lizzie</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/5204/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/5204/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=5204&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

He knows what it is like to not feel alive.</p>
<p>This song isn’t just The Color Morale’s, it is ours as well. We’re one and the same.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Pittsburgh&#8221; by The Amity Affliction</strong></p>
<p>The first single released from The Amity Affliction’s latest album <i>Let the Ocean Take Me,</i> “Pittsburgh,” is one of the best songs of 2014. Many songs have been released this year, but not many are as great as this one. From relatable lyrics referring to a person with suicidal thoughts, to a children’s choir singing on the track (adding a darker aspect), and a perfect balance between clean vocalist Ahren Stringer and heavy vocalist Joel Birch. “I can’t take another step/ l cannot live inside my mind/I can’t face another day/I am so [flipping] tired.” This song is very personal for Joel Birch. It’s about feeling like you’re trapped by depression and trying to fight against it. Some speculate this song was inspired by a near death experience he had a year ago or so. He wrote this song to fight off the monsters within. “This one’s for me, because I need to exorcise these  demons,” sings Birch.</p>
<p>Making this a wonderful anthem of trying to hold on and keeping life together.</p>

<p><strong>&#8220;Cover You Up&#8221; by Real Friends</strong></p>
<p>Keeping with their classic pop-punk image while also creating fresh and original music is a feat that not many bands have been able to accomplish, but Real Friends’ song “Cover You Up” does both. It deserves a spot in the top eight songs of 2014. Lyrically it stays with the theme of the band, pushing images of loss yet triumph, the feeling of moving forward and gaining the strength to be independent. Lines like, “I only miss you late at night when I can’t sleep,” or “I find comfort in weakness because it’s always there for me” provide a strong connection between the band and its listeners by bringing common feelings to light. Musically, it is taking major steps forward also, which can be seen through the new instrumental patterns and overall maturity, both of which could be attributed to their signing with Fearless Records. The lyrics, mood and overall aesthetics of this song can make almost anyone feel a personal connection with this five piece Chicago band, and “Cover You Up” is one of their absolute bests.</p>

<p><strong>&#8220;Your Graduation&#8221; by Modern Baseball</strong></p>
<p>Coming from a band comprised of a few college kids that are used to playing in people’s basements in Philadelphia, Modern Baseball’s new album <em>You’re Gonna Miss It All</em> was a big step forward for them. The song “Your Graduation” is arguably the most popular song on the album, and for good reason. Apart from simply being a catchy and upbeat song about life as a twenty-something-year-old, the song represents some great aspects of the band. Through their lyrics Modern Baseball shares a rare connection with ordinary listeners, making them feel as if they are all connected in some way. The band does not portray themselves on a pedestal, and lines like, “I swear this has got to be the hundredth time I’ve thought of you tonight” really push the idea that they are just like everyone else; they experience hardships, sad times, and self pity. “Your Graduation” is a song that brings many of these thoughts to life, shows positivity through adversity and is a sure winner for the top songs of 2014.</p>

<p><strong>&#8220;History&#8221; by This Wild Life</strong></p>
<p>This Wild Life, an acoustic duo, released their debut full-length album in May of this year. The disc’s highlight is a track titled “History.” Covering a very relatable subject, “History” tells the thoughts of a man contemplating leaving his current relationship from a troubled perspective, focusing on the decisions to be made despite an extensive past. Kevin Jordan emotionally sings, “We’ve got a lot of history but there’s too much space between you and me. You have plans and I have dreams, but do I have the guts in me to leave?” The lyrics put the listener in his shoes, causing contemplation of current or previous relationships. “History” makes a connection so real that you’ll feel as though This Wild Life is always right there beside you, understanding you. The deep thoughts paired with an infectious acoustic sound keep “History” forever in your head. That’s good because unlike the man in the song, you will never question for a second that you might want this song to leave. Trust me, you won’t want it to.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Stingray Affliction&#8221; by Issues</strong></p>
<p>One of 2014’s best comes from a new band fronted by both Michael Bohn and Tyler Carter, named Issues. “Stingray Affliction,” from the band’s eponymously titled debut album, proves to be one of the year’s most interesting and exciting songs. Each member in this six piece comes from a different musical background and with “Stingray Affliction” it shows in the best possible way. It opens with heavy guitars, DJ scratches, and catchy drum beats as it moves into Bohn’s screaming verses, seemingly trying to be a solid hardcore song. It quickly appears Issues has an agenda of their own when the track transitions into a chorus of hard rocking electro-punk where Carter belts out his gripping vocals. As if you already couldn’t be thrown for another heavenly loop, the bridge takes you to Carter’s true showcase where it all slows down into a smooth R/B feel that will leave you breathless. By the end of this musical thrill ride, your brain will try to wrap itself around how it all flows together so effortlessly but the only cure is to put this catchy masterpiece on repeat and be blown away.</p>

<p><strong>&#8220;Escape Route&#8221; [Deluxe Version] by Paramore</strong></p>
<p>Running away and starting a new life is very appetizing to many who are trying to get out of their hometown to a big city and start their dream life. Writing a song on this popular topic could be seen as redundant. Almost a year after the debut of Paramore’s self-titled album, the band has released the deluxe version of this chart-topper. “Escape Route” is arguably the most prominent, being a new deluxe release-only track. This is not just any ordinary song about escaping to your new life. The singer, Hayley Williams, touches on the fact that many do have this dream, and she is not the only person in the world that is “miserable” with their current life. “Where I&#8217;m going is everyone&#8217;s story. We want, you left, we left to start over. It’s not a question of who are we really. It’s who we want to be”. Williams makes it known that many have this dream, and she is not the only one. It shuts down the impression that someone who wants that life is “special.” It eliminates the feeling of being an “outcast”. It gives an isolated dreamer a sense of community.</p>

<p><strong>&#8220;Say Goodbye&#8221; by Krewella</strong></p>
<p>“Say Goodbye” by the new and improved Krewella has hit the internet with the intention of making a statement. This song was the Yousaf sisters’ response to Rain Man’s legal action, and a new direction to the group. This new track runs away from the popish melody of their first album <em>Get Wet</em> and has a more rockish feeling to it, officially falling under the drum &amp; bass genre. Wanting to prove that they are serious musicians, the Yousaf sisters released this song in response to their partner and producer suing the group for wrongfully banishing him from the musical act. Producer Kris, “Rain Man” Trindl, has stated some pretty serious accusations of his former band mates, sisters Yasmine and Jahan Yousaf: that they kicked him out so they only had to split the profits two ways rather than three. Bashing the sisters’ musical skills, Rain Man received many supporters, while the sisters were receiving hate messages from many former fans. Jahan and Yasmine briefly responded asking the fans to stick around for their rebuttal after consulting with their legal team. A few days later, all of Krewella’s social media profile pictures were changed to a completely black photo with faint writing that read “Say Goodbye.” Many took to the comment boards starting rumors that the group was disbanding due to the lawsuit. The next day, a song was released titled “Say Goodbye.” The lyrics state “It still kills me, that I can&#8217;t change things. But I&#8217;m still dreaming. I’ll rewrite the ending, so you&#8217;ll take back the lies, before we say our goodbyes.” These lyrics could arguably be interpreted as being directed towards Rain Man. Whether or not every fan likes the new direction, Krewella is showing that they are sticking around. This song is the beginning of the “new” Krewella.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Well, there y’all go. 2014 looks awesome so far already. I’m very much looking forward to the new Alcest album entitled <em>Shelter.</em> The two singles so far released have been incredible. If the entire album is as good as those two songs it will probably even top their last masterpiece <em>Les Voyages de L&#8217;Âme</em>, which says a lot. This new song right here is beyond amazing:</h4>
<h4><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9wxZ1DV9xO4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What I’m most looking forward to this year would have to be the promised new Agalloch album. They are my favorite band of all time and have yet to disappoint me with any music they have put out. Other artists that are releasing new music that I am excited for include Cynic, Wintersun, Behemoth, potential Wolves in the Throne Room, potential Skyharbor, Periphery, and a lot more. 2013 was amazing but I’m anticipating 2014 will be even better. Maybe next year I’ll be able to make a top 100 list…only time will tell.</h4>
<h4>Also, I might add the music I released in 2013. <a href="http://thebrokenarecrowned.bandcamp.com/album/trenches-ep">The Broken Are Crowned’s “Trenches” EP</a> and the <a href="https://collateralsplatter.bandcamp.com/track/a-walking-body-bag">first single from Collateral Splatter</a>. As for what 2014 holds musically for me, Collateral Splatter will be releasing our debut EP, I am working on a full length album with a TBA project, and The Broken Are Crowned has a very big show coming up with Animals as Leaders, After the Burial, Veil of Maya, Chon, Reflections and others on March 9th, so tweet at me if you need a ticket! @nick_stanger TBAC will most likely begin writing and recording new material soon as well.</h4>
<h4>Thus concludes my musical summary of the year. Carry on.</h4>

<p>Over the weekend, I decided to get my holiday groove on and listen to some heavy Christmas jams, blasting “Kidnap the Sandy Claus” (courtesy of Korn in association with Disney’s “A Nightmare Before Christmas”), all the merry night long. While sitting in an armchair of real arms with my wrought-iron mug of scalding hot cocoa, I started to ponder&#8230; how could this season get any more brütal? Here, we take a jolly journey to find the answers.</p>
<p><strong>1. Greek Election Riots, 2008</strong></p>
<p>Starting on a serious note, the setting is Greece, 2008, when a young man is killed by the police. The further inaction of the nation’s judicial system lights a fuse that ends on the most festive of holidays: Christmas. Though their methods may have been extreme, hundreds of people around the world revolted to shed light on police brutality and lift up the standards of living for the younger generation.</p>
<p>(Totally brütal, totally too dark, so lets find some other things to brighten this list up.)</p>
<p><strong>2. Incandescent Christmas Tree Lights</strong></p>
<p>The hottest lights on the market; power to end them all in the death of one. Tangled and bunched, they’ll always show you who’s boss.</p>
<p><strong>3. Party Santa</strong><br />
Stage presents? Check.</p>

<p><strong>4. Waffle Maker Riots, 2011</strong></p>
<p>Long story short, when Wal-Mart sells waffle makers for $2 each, you had better hope they keep plenty in stock and their aisles wide enough for stampede.</p>
<p><strong>5. These sick Slayer sweaters.</strong></p>
<p>Ho Ho OH YES.<br />

<p><strong>6.  Who needs physics when you’re this brütal?</strong><br />
Upside down trees: For when upside down crosses are a bit too cliche (and just out of season).</p>

<p><strong>9. It snowed in Cairo for the first time in  110 years.</strong></p>
<p>That’s totally tubular, and extra brütal.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[by Keenan Video games today consist of high definition graphics, movie-like cinematic cut scenes, and fully orchestrated music. When video games were first introduced they were nothing more than a few pixels, simple-but-inventive stories, and some repetitive theme music that no matter what you did you couldn’t get out of your head. Those simple 8-bit tracks are the most amazing and nostalgic part of video games. I go back to my great and powerful Nintendo Entertainment System often, spending hours at a time fighting Ganon or Dr. Wily, enjoying the music of so many games. These are my top 10. 10. Contra &#8211; “Jungle Theme” If you want a great action game go play this, it is to this day my favorite Konami game with some of the coolest tracks in it, but Jungle Theme is the one that stands out to me.

<h4>Video games today consist of high definition graphics, movie-like cinematic cut scenes, and fully orchestrated music. When video games were first introduced they were nothing more than a few pixels, simple-but-inventive stories, and some repetitive theme music that no matter what you did you couldn’t get out of your head. Those simple 8-bit tracks are the most amazing and nostalgic part of video games.</h4>
<h4>I go back to my great and powerful Nintendo Entertainment System often, spending hours at a time fighting Ganon or Dr. Wily, enjoying the music of so many games.</h4>
<h4>These are my top 10.</h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>10. Contra &#8211; “Jungle Theme”</strong><br />

<h4><strong>9. Zelda 2 &#8211; “Palace Theme”</strong></h4>
<h4><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/7a7Sh82Mzdc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></h4>
<h4>I know Zelda 2 is the worst zelda game ever made&#8211;even Miyamoto thinks so&#8211;but the moment you walk into a palace for the first time, you&#8217;ll feel that sense of creepiness that can&#8217;t be matched by any other 8-bit theme. There are so many zelda tracks, but this is definitely one of my favorites.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>8. Megaman 3 &#8211; “Ending Theme”</strong></h4>
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/CKpPKyDx2mQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<h4>This is probably my favorite ending theme in any game. After beating Megaman 3, I got this feeling of complete satisfaction not because I beat the game, but because of this song. This says “Hey it&#8217;s over, but your next adventure is around the corner” and I don&#8217;t think I could ever forget it.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>7. Kirby&#8217;s Adventure &#8211; “Butter Building”</strong></h4>
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/o5nkX_D5Xdw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<h4>One of the catchiest and underrated videogame songs to exist in the 8-bit days. I would just sit on a level to listen to this song over and over again, it&#8217;s just that good. The Kirby franchise in general makes amazing theme songs, which is a huge reason why it&#8217;s my favorite video game series.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>6. Castlevania &#8211; “Main Theme”</strong></h4>
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/JYfgpodCVHE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<h4>I don&#8217;t really know what else to say besides the fact that this game is perfection. Honestly it has some of the best gameplay styles and story ever made, and it&#8217;s music was phenomenal. I know I said Contra was my favorite Konami game, but this is such a close second&#8211;how I wish they&#8217;d make better Castlevania games today.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>5. Legend of Zelda &#8211; “Overworld”</strong></h4>
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/lpEzYEoV9qY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<h4>Legend of Zelda is one of the most known franchises in the world, right behind Mario. It brings the most innovatively fun experiences that only a Zelda game can give. In the original, you were dropped into a huge world with no map, no help&#8211;you had nothing until you talked to that old man who gives you a wooden sword and tells you you&#8217;re on your own. This theme may well be the only theme song from this era to be as relevant as it is today, everyone knows it, and it&#8217;s probably stuck in your head just by reading the heading.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>4. Super Mario 2 &#8211; “Overworld”</strong></h4>
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/yBISfv-6hfo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<h4>You knew it was coming: a Mario game on the best 8-bit music list. Well, here it is. Mario 2 changed gaming in a lot of ways, just like its predecessor, and the music doesn&#8217;t disappoint. I could go on and on about how great the first 3 Super Mario games and themes are, but there&#8217;s no point, everyone knows the glory of Mario and the music that come with.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>3. Metroid &#8211; “Kraid”</strong></h4>
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/_UGKCvIrF_o?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<h4>Metroid was a groundbreaking achievement for Nintendo. Metroid is an intense and complex game with proper music to go with, even though Kraid&#8217;s lair theme was just video game music, it felt like it wasn&#8217;t. To me the game came alive for the first time I became Samus&#8230;and then I found out Samus was actually a girl.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>2. DuckTales &#8211; “Moon”</strong></h4>
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/KF32DRg9opA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<h4>Ducktales is a game that defines 8-bit glory. Scrooge McDuck a former adventurist goes off on one last adventure after being robbed from his own bank. The game makes nostalgia feel nostalgic, and it brings the best collection of 8-bit music I know&#8211;the Moon theme being the most notable. If you haven&#8217;t played DuckTales before, you&#8217;re in luck, they completely remastered the game recently making it an even more amazing.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>1. Megaman 2 &#8211; “Dr. Wily”</strong></h4>
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/WJRoRt155mA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<h4>If you think there&#8217;s a theme song from the NES days that&#8217;s better than this one, I really want to hear it. Megaman is so legendary, it amazes me Capcom doesn&#8217;t make another one. This whole stage is intense as can be, but at least the theme music gives you just enough strength to get through. You don&#8217;t know how excited I was to hear Megaman is in the next Smash Bros. game.</h4>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>So there you have it, my top 10 for best 8-bit video game music. Nostalgia at its finest. I hope you all agree with my selection, but if you have your own list I&#8217;d love to see it.</h4><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/1799/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/1799/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=1799&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
