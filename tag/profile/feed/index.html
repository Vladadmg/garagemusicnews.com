<p>If you’ve ever listened to Modern Baseball, your immediate reaction was probably something like, “hmm… this is interesting…” or “I wonder if my crappy high school band could have made it…” followed by some uncomfortable laughter. Or maybe that was just mine. Upon first listen, the group of Philadelphia twenty-something-year-olds sounded like one of your typical semi-talented garage bands, and maybe they even act like it.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at their song, “Your Graduation,” for example.<br />
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/MbrUzJlTffs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe><br />
The song begins with a poorly distorted guitar and lead singer Brendan Lukens’ voice. It sounds simple, like the singer couldn’t be more unenthused about the song as he drags his oddly toned voice through some droning lyrics. The words seem disconnected from the song, as there are a lot of them, and they carry no true rhythm or structure for most of the track. The song continues to build up as pounding drums and bass join in. From here the song’s structure seems to be unpredictable. My cynical self could have been found scowling when it decided to end the build-up with a couple of simple strums and a whiny chorus. It only continues to get weirder when it builds up again and drops into a Sum-41-style verse where the drummer chimes in with some angry, resentful singing.</p>
<p>It would be all too easy to listen to the song once, never touch it again, and go merrily on your way on a search for something else; but oh what a shame that would be. “Your Graduation” is actually a masterpiece waiting to be discovered, just like the rest of MoBo’s catalog.</p>
<p>Take a second to dissect it while giving it a few listens and you will see why. Those “droning” lyrics that just don’t seem to fit the song, remember those? They are actually really poetic and brutally honest.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s been three whole years of me thinking about you every day</em></p>
<p><em>Sometimes for hours, sometimes in passing</em></p>
<p><em>Saw you from the bottom of the staircase</em></p>
<p><em>Stood out for hours as you complained</em></p>
<p><em>About how you haven&#8217;t seen your friends yet</em></p>
<p><em>That you&#8217;re too drunk to stand and</em></p>
<p><em>You not knowing if you can love him forever</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Bull**** you f***ing miss me</em></p>
<p><em>There I said it I guess I&#8217;ll talk to you in a few months</em></p>
<p><em>Sitting drunk on the sidewalk</em></p>
<p><em>I guess I&#8217;ll get up</em></p>
<p><em>I guess I&#8217;ll go for a walk</em></p>
<p><em>Press my shoes against the pavement</em></p>
<p><em>I swear this has got to be the hundredth</em></p>
<p><em>Time I&#8217;ve thought of you tonight</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They look as though they are straight out of high school diary. Lukens takes a unique approach by using the specific moments of a heartbreaking situation to tell a story. They are exactly what everyone may have thought after a breakup but never had the guts to say (<em>Bull**** you f***ing miss me. There I said it, I guess I’ll talk to you in a few months.</em>). Lukens takes you into his mind and lets you sit with his thoughts, potentially leaving you feeling as though you know him personally. So yes, they may lie awkwardly over the music, but think about “Mr. Brightside” by The Killers and tell me that situational, disjointed lyrics have never worked successfully in a song before.</p>
<p>The unenthused style of singing also may sound rough around the edges at times, but only further conveys Lukens’ sadness in the end, subconsciously giving “Your Graduation” even more depth. This same technique is prominent in other MoBo songs such as, “Fine, Great,” “Re-Done,” and the new track, “The Waterboy Returns.”</p>
<p>I also previously criticized the bizarre song structure, but upon further reflection, do we really need another typical pop-punk/emo band? The track carries at least three parts that could have been broken into separate songs, and it links them with ease. An acoustic rant, a mid-2000s punk song, and a good old rock and roll jam session in the garage are all seamlessly put to together into one song that dares you to be bored. Although things can at times sound as if they happened by accident, such as the simple guitar solo near the end of the song or the sporadic drum fills throughout, it has an odd charm about it. This charm translates to the band’s live show and their image.</p>
<p>The guys in Modern Baseball aren’t trying to be refined. Catch them at any of their shows and you can bet that they will look just like a few typical college students, dressed in ratty tees, athletic pants or cargo shorts, and greasy, unkempt haircuts. Modern Baseball is also, <a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/2015/12/01/live-at-the-garage-1127-modern-baseball/">as I mentioned in my previous review</a>, “endearingly awkward” on stage, as the band’s lack of stage presence is oddly attractive. They simply act as though they are playing the music for themselves, just as one would at home in their garage. They make each other laugh even though they are singing into a mic, have water fights between songs, and make stroppy advances at each other while playing.</p>
<p>So, although on the surface, Modern Baseball may seem like a bunch of Average Joes who play music in their free time, they are secretly one of the more talented and charismatic groups in today’s alternative music scene. Never judge a song or band by your first listen because there could be so much more beneath the surface.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/6474/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/6474/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=6474&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>by <a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/maddy/">Maddy Siiter</a></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I sat down with Max Timander, frontman of Cherry Cola (Stereo Confession), during his lunch break on a Saturday afternoon in a tropical themed Vietnamese restaurant. He carried in a cartoon lunchbox full of applesauce and tortilla chips and by the humility in his personality, you wouldn’t know just how successful the young singer/guitarist has already been. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Not many 12-year-olds are running successful music blogs and not many 18-year-olds can say their band has been on tour and signed to a label. It might not be typical, but it’s normal to him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Timander started his blog </span><a href="http://areyourockin.blogspot.com/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Are You Rockin’</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> in middle school with encouragement from his dad, who ran a magazine. When he got in contact with the head music critic at the </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Star Tribune</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, more and more bands started sending him their music for review, surprised or not at his young age. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I would get home from school and write a couple reviews on like, the newest Green Day album or something,” Timander says, who was a regular at local shows in middle school, even on school nights. “No one else at my school was doing that. Everyone else was just listening to Katy Perry or something. I definitely had a different life going on than most of the kids around me at the time.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It would only take a little bit of time after that for Stereo Confession to form, originating in Rock Band class &#8212; students were told to pick up instruments and learn various cover songs from popular bands like Journey and Evanescence. Timander, who calls Jack White “a madman” and his biggest musical influence growing up, decided against what was assigned to learn. “In my specific group, we did a cover of the White Stripes song, ‘Hardest Button to Button’ and the three of us really clicked over it, so we just decided to start out as a three piece.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">When The Current picked up Stereo Confession’s song ‘Video Games,’ the number of band members grew along with their popularity around town. The five piece surf-rock band signed to Minneapolis-based label Susstones Records through their producer and toured through parts of the Midwest and East Coast in the spring and summer of this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It seemed like Stereo Confession was on the top of the world, so it came as a shock to many fans when Max and the band announced they’d be playing their last show together at the end of summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Sitting back in the worn, red booth, Timander looked to be choosing his words carefully before elaborating on the break-up. “It was time. It just became more difficult to write as a band and get together to practice at the same time. It was getting weird and just happened.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But with the loyalty of the local music scene, Timander isn’t worried about people not catching on to the transition. “When [Stereo Confession] broke up, and </span><a href="http://blog.thecurrent.org/2015/08/stereo-confession-a-post-break-up-retrospective/"><span style="font-weight:400;">The Current did the profile on it</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> they really touched base on that I had [Cherry Cola] together and that I already had shows coming up.” </span></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/3iRvthoKJGQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I wanted something that was paying off. It’s under my image and each [band members] have our own names [within the band]. That’s why I started Cherry Cola, just to get my own ideas out there and have it feel a little more rewarding,” Timander says, this time sounding a little more optimistic. “It’s heavier and grungier, louder. It’s nice to be in a new group and experiment with it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">As for what’s next for Cherry Cola, Timander says there’s talk of tour and new music in the future. His days as a middle school music blogger might be over, but it’s time for Max to be on the other end of the review. </span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[by Lizzie When I saw The Maine on their Free For All tour last month, I had no idea who their opening band was going to be. I had never heard of Beach Weather before, but I was immediately drawn in by their energetic stage presence and fine-tuned, infectious live sound.

<p><em>by <a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/lizzie/">Lizzie</a></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">When I saw The Maine on their Free For All tour last month, I had no idea who their opening band was going to be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I had never heard of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/beachweathermusic">Beach Weather</a> before, but I was immediately drawn in by their energetic stage presence and fine-tuned, infectious live sound. So you can imagine how impressed I was when they told the audience it was only their fourth show. Ever. But I was also very confused: how did such a brand new band manage to score a spot on such a highly anticipated tour?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Here’s how. Beach Weather is fronted by Nick Santino, an already successful alt-rock artist and close friend of The Maine. At the beginning of this year, Santino formed the band Beach Weather along with Ian Holubiak, Reeve Powers, and Austin Scates. Though they’ve only recently come together, none of the members are amateurs when it comes to touring and playing music. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Santino, in addition to releasing multiple solo EP’s in 2013 and 2014, was the lead singer of the band A Rocket to the Moon from 2006 to 2013. “I</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> was a part of the group Oh Honey right out of college,” Holubiak said, “and [Austin] toured with Lydia. Reeve had his own group growing up and hopped into this band while establishing himself musically in Nashville. All the acts we played with previously were simply wonderful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">After writing and releasing their debut EP </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">What a Drag</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, they immediately joined The Maine on tour, thanks to their friendship with the band. When I asked about the writing process of the EP, Nick explained, “</span><span style="font-weight:400;">We actually wrote most of the songs on a bass plugged into a guitar amp for some reason. We realized writing songs on other instruments than just a guitar seems to strike different ideas and influence.” The unconventional approach definitely worked, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">because </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">What a Drag</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> is fresh and unique like a debut should be, and the songs are each as good standing alone as they are all together. It’s a classic pop rock sound, but it has an element of dreaminess that sets it apart from other records of the same genre.</span></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8dCCzyrt7C4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Although the sound is a departure from what they’ve done before, it still contains traces of the members’ previous work, particularly A Rocket to The Moon. “Rebel Sun,” the final track on </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">What a Drag</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, sounds like it should be a song off </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Wild and Free, </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">ARTTM’s 2013 album, with its lyrical storytelling and effortlessly poppy chorus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In addition to their old bands, Beach Weather have a wide variety of influences. But their songwriting principle remains consistent: “</span><span style="font-weight:400;">I personally can listen to Biggie in the same playlist as Bob Dylan. Regardless of our influences, though, we like to play groovy music, noise that makes people want to dance and keep moving.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Opening for the Maine on their fall tour was the first time the band played shows all together, but you never would have guessed it. Often</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> I find it more difficult to really enjoy and be involved in a band’s live performance if I’ve never listened to their music before, but with these guys it immediately clicked. Their performance was as precise as a recording, but contained that undeniable energy and emotion that can only be captured at a live show. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Their song “Swoon” was a definite highlight, as well as an on-point cover of The Cure’s “Friday I’m In Love”. They had me up on my feet and dancing along with the rest of the crowd the whole night, and really seemed to love what they were doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For a brand-new band they’re gaining traction crazy quickly, and aren’t planning on stopping anytime soon. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">“We were lucky enough to get a spot on the Sleeping With Sirens tour that heads to Europe in February. When the news hit we were absolutely amazed at the amount of support we got from all of our fans.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Beach Weather are a band to get familiar with, because with two big supporting tours and a killer sound, they’re sure to continue making waves.</span></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/5815/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/5815/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=5815&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Rachael tackled Infinite Me and Sararosa took on Hippo Campus as two bands with local roots taking great steps forward. Infinite Me With a brand new singer, a brand new sound, and a brand new album, Infinite Me is back and ready to take on the scene. This five-piece has grown up a lot since we last saw them in the fall. Deano &#8220;The Don&#8221; Erickson (Molly&#8217;s Worst Enemy, Internet Dating) replaced Corey Short as the frontman, and brought a new direction along with him to this already “ever-changing band.” As bandmates in Molly’s Worst Enemy, adding Erickson didn’t take a lot of thought for guitarist Colby Moores. “We needed a vocalist, Deano wanted to do vocals. It was pretty simple,” he said. Bassist Jackie Fleming admitte<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><rss version="2.0"

<p>If you’ve ever listened to Modern Baseball, your immediate reaction was probably something like, “hmm… this is interesting…” or “I wonder if my crappy high school band could have made it…” followed by some uncomfortable laughter. Or maybe that was just mine. Upon first listen, the group of Philadelphia twenty-something-year-olds sounded like one of your typical semi-talented garage bands, and maybe they even act like it.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at their song, “Your Graduation,” for example.<br />
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/MbrUzJlTffs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe><br />
The song begins with a poorly distorted guitar and lead singer Brendan Lukens’ voice. It sounds simple, like the singer couldn’t be more unenthused about the song as he drags his oddly toned voice through some droning lyrics. The words seem disconnected from the song, as there are a lot of them, and they carry no true rhythm or structure for most of the track. The song continues to build up as pounding drums and bass join in. From here the song’s structure seems to be unpredictable. My cynical self could have been found scowling when it decided to end the build-up with a couple of simple strums and a whiny chorus. It only continues to get weirder when it builds up again and drops into a Sum-41-style verse where the drummer chimes in with some angry, resentful singing.</p>
<p>It would be all too easy to listen to the song once, never touch it again, and go merrily on your way on a search for something else; but oh what a shame that would be. “Your Graduation” is actually a masterpiece waiting to be discovered, just like the rest of MoBo’s catalog.</p>
<p>Take a second to dissect it while giving it a few listens and you will see why. Those “droning” lyrics that just don’t seem to fit the song, remember those? They are actually really poetic and brutally honest.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s been three whole years of me thinking about you every day</em></p>
<p><em>Sometimes for hours, sometimes in passing</em></p>
<p><em>Saw you from the bottom of the staircase</em></p>
<p><em>Stood out for hours as you complained</em></p>
<p><em>About how you haven&#8217;t seen your friends yet</em></p>
<p><em>That you&#8217;re too drunk to stand and</em></p>
<p><em>You not knowing if you can love him forever</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Bull**** you f***ing miss me</em></p>
<p><em>There I said it I guess I&#8217;ll talk to you in a few months</em></p>
<p><em>Sitting drunk on the sidewalk</em></p>
<p><em>I guess I&#8217;ll get up</em></p>
<p><em>I guess I&#8217;ll go for a walk</em></p>
<p><em>Press my shoes against the pavement</em></p>
<p><em>I swear this has got to be the hundredth</em></p>
<p><em>Time I&#8217;ve thought of you tonight</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They look as though they are straight out of high school diary. Lukens takes a unique approach by using the specific moments of a heartbreaking situation to tell a story. They are exactly what everyone may have thought after a breakup but never had the guts to say (<em>Bull**** you f***ing miss me. There I said it, I guess I’ll talk to you in a few months.</em>). Lukens takes you into his mind and lets you sit with his thoughts, potentially leaving you feeling as though you know him personally. So yes, they may lie awkwardly over the music, but think about “Mr. Brightside” by The Killers and tell me that situational, disjointed lyrics have never worked successfully in a song before.</p>
<p>The unenthused style of singing also may sound rough around the edges at times, but only further conveys Lukens’ sadness in the end, subconsciously giving “Your Graduation” even more depth. This same technique is prominent in other MoBo songs such as, “Fine, Great,” “Re-Done,” and the new track, “The Waterboy Returns.”</p>
<p>I also previously criticized the bizarre song structure, but upon further reflection, do we really need another typical pop-punk/emo band? The track carries at least three parts that could have been broken into separate songs, and it links them with ease. An acoustic rant, a mid-2000s punk song, and a good old rock and roll jam session in the garage are all seamlessly put to together into one song that dares you to be bored. Although things can at times sound as if they happened by accident, such as the simple guitar solo near the end of the song or the sporadic drum fills throughout, it has an odd charm about it. This charm translates to the band’s live show and their image.</p>
<p>The guys in Modern Baseball aren’t trying to be refined. Catch them at any of their shows and you can bet that they will look just like a few typical college students, dressed in ratty tees, athletic pants or cargo shorts, and greasy, unkempt haircuts. Modern Baseball is also, <a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/2015/12/01/live-at-the-garage-1127-modern-baseball/">as I mentioned in my previous review</a>, “endearingly awkward” on stage, as the band’s lack of stage presence is oddly attractive. They simply act as though they are playing the music for themselves, just as one would at home in their garage. They make each other laugh even though they are singing into a mic, have water fights between songs, and make stroppy advances at each other while playing.</p>
<p>So, although on the surface, Modern Baseball may seem like a bunch of Average Joes who play music in their free time, they are secretly one of the more talented and charismatic groups in today’s alternative music scene. Never judge a song or band by your first listen because there could be so much more beneath the surface.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/6474/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/6474/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=6474&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>by <a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/maddy/">Maddy Siiter</a></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I sat down with Max Timander, frontman of Cherry Cola (Stereo Confession), during his lunch break on a Saturday afternoon in a tropical themed Vietnamese restaurant. He carried in a cartoon lunchbox full of applesauce and tortilla chips and by the humility in his personality, you wouldn’t know just how successful the young singer/guitarist has already been. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Not many 12-year-olds are running successful music blogs and not many 18-year-olds can say their band has been on tour and signed to a label. It might not be typical, but it’s normal to him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Timander started his blog </span><a href="http://areyourockin.blogspot.com/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Are You Rockin’</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> in middle school with encouragement from his dad, who ran a magazine. When he got in contact with the head music critic at the </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Star Tribune</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, more and more bands started sending him their music for review, surprised or not at his young age. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I would get home from school and write a couple reviews on like, the newest Green Day album or something,” Timander says, who was a regular at local shows in middle school, even on school nights. “No one else at my school was doing that. Everyone else was just listening to Katy Perry or something. I definitely had a different life going on than most of the kids around me at the time.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It would only take a little bit of time after that for Stereo Confession to form, originating in Rock Band class &#8212; students were told to pick up instruments and learn various cover songs from popular bands like Journey and Evanescence. Timander, who calls Jack White “a madman” and his biggest musical influence growing up, decided against what was assigned to learn. “In my specific group, we did a cover of the White Stripes song, ‘Hardest Button to Button’ and the three of us really clicked over it, so we just decided to start out as a three piece.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">When The Current picked up Stereo Confession’s song ‘Video Games,’ the number of band members grew along with their popularity around town. The five piece surf-rock band signed to Minneapolis-based label Susstones Records through their producer and toured through parts of the Midwest and East Coast in the spring and summer of this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It seemed like Stereo Confession was on the top of the world, so it came as a shock to many fans when Max and the band announced they’d be playing their last show together at the end of summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Sitting back in the worn, red booth, Timander looked to be choosing his words carefully before elaborating on the break-up. “It was time. It just became more difficult to write as a band and get together to practice at the same time. It was getting weird and just happened.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But with the loyalty of the local music scene, Timander isn’t worried about people not catching on to the transition. “When [Stereo Confession] broke up, and </span><a href="http://blog.thecurrent.org/2015/08/stereo-confession-a-post-break-up-retrospective/"><span style="font-weight:400;">The Current did the profile on it</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> they really touched base on that I had [Cherry Cola] together and that I already had shows coming up.” </span></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/3iRvthoKJGQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I wanted something that was paying off. It’s under my image and each [band members] have our own names [within the band]. That’s why I started Cherry Cola, just to get my own ideas out there and have it feel a little more rewarding,” Timander says, this time sounding a little more optimistic. “It’s heavier and grungier, louder. It’s nice to be in a new group and experiment with it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">As for what’s next for Cherry Cola, Timander says there’s talk of tour and new music in the future. His days as a middle school music blogger might be over, but it’s time for Max to be on the other end of the review. </span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[by Lizzie When I saw The Maine on their Free For All tour last month, I had no idea who their opening band was going to be. I had never heard of Beach Weather before, but I was immediately drawn in by their energetic stage presence and fine-tuned, infectious live sound. So you can imagine how impressed I was when they told the audience it was only their fourth show. Ever. But I was also very confused: how did such a brand new band manage to score a spot on such a highly anticipated tour? Here’s how. Beach Weather is fronted by Nick Santino, an already successful alt-rock artist and close friend of The Maine.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://garagemusicnews.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/beach-weather-2015.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5816" src="https://garagemusicnews.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/beach-weather-2015.jpg?w=940&#038;h=627" alt="beach-weather-2015"   /></a></p>
<p><em>by <a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/lizzie/">Lizzie</a></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">When I saw The Maine on their Free For All tour last month, I had no idea who their opening band was going to be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I had never heard of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/beachweathermusic">Beach Weather</a> before, but I was immediately drawn in by their energetic stage presence and fine-tuned, infectious live sound. So you can imagine how impressed I was when they told the audience it was only their fourth show. Ever. But I was also very confused: how did such a brand new band manage to score a spot on such a highly anticipated tour?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Here’s how. Beach Weather is fronted by Nick Santino, an already successful alt-rock artist and close friend of The Maine. At the beginning of this year, Santino formed the band Beach Weather along with Ian Holubiak, Reeve Powers, and Austin Scates. Though they’ve only recently come together, none of the members are amateurs when it comes to touring and playing music. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Santino, in addition to releasing multiple solo EP’s in 2013 and 2014, was the lead singer of the band A Rocket to the Moon from 2006 to 2013. “I</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> was a part of the group Oh Honey right out of college,” Holubiak said, “and [Austin] toured with Lydia. Reeve had his own group growing up and hopped into this band while establishing himself musically in Nashville. All the acts we played with previously were simply wonderful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">After writing and releasing their debut EP </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">What a Drag</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, they immediately joined The Maine on tour, thanks to their friendship with the band. When I asked about the writing process of the EP, Nick explained, “</span><span style="font-weight:400;">We actually wrote most of the songs on a bass plugged into a guitar amp for some reason. We realized writing songs on other instruments than just a guitar seems to strike different ideas and influence.” The unconventional approach definitely worked, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">because </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">What a Drag</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> is fresh and unique like a debut should be, and the songs are each as good standing alone as they are all together. It’s a classic pop rock sound, but it has an element of dreaminess that sets it apart from other records of the same genre.</span></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8dCCzyrt7C4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Although the sound is a departure from what they’ve done before, it still contains traces of the members’ previous work, particularly A Rocket to The Moon. “Rebel Sun,” the final track on </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">What a Drag</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, sounds like it should be a song off </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Wild and Free, </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">ARTTM’s 2013 album, with its lyrical storytelling and effortlessly poppy chorus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In addition to their old bands, Beach Weather have a wide variety of influences. But their songwriting principle remains consistent: “</span><span style="font-weight:400;">I personally can listen to Biggie in the same playlist as Bob Dylan. Regardless of our influences, though, we like to play groovy music, noise that makes people want to dance and keep moving.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Opening for the Maine on their fall tour was the first time the band played shows all together, but you never would have guessed it. Often</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> I find it more difficult to really enjoy and be involved in a band’s live performance if I’ve never listened to their music before, but with these guys it immediately clicked. Their performance was as precise as a recording, but contained that undeniable energy and emotion that can only be captured at a live show. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Their song “Swoon” was a definite highlight, as well as an on-point cover of The Cure’s “Friday I’m In Love”. They had me up on my feet and dancing along with the rest of the crowd the whole night, and really seemed to love what they were doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For a brand-new band they’re gaining traction crazy quickly, and aren’t planning on stopping anytime soon. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">“We were lucky enough to get a spot on the Sleeping With Sirens tour that heads to Europe in February. When the news hit we were absolutely amazed at the amount of support we got from all of our fans.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Beach Weather are a band to get familiar with, because with two big supporting tours and a killer sound, they’re sure to continue making waves.</span></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/5815/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/5815/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=5815&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>With the seasons changing, The Garage under construction, the scene continuing to grow, our writers were interested in &#8220;progress&#8221; this month. Rachael tackled Infinite Me and Sararosa took on Hippo Campus as two bands with local roots taking great steps forward.</em></p>
<h4>Infinite Me</h4>
<p>With a brand new singer, a brand new sound, and a brand new album, Infinite Me is back and ready to take on the scene. This five-piece has grown up a lot since we last saw them in the fall. Deano &#8220;The Don&#8221; Erickson (Molly&#8217;s Worst Enemy, Internet Dating) replaced Corey Short as the frontman, and brought a new direction along with him to this already “ever-changing band.”</p>
<p>As bandmates in Molly’s Worst Enemy, adding Erickson didn’t take a lot of thought for guitarist Colby Moores. “We needed a vocalist, Deano wanted to do vocals. It was pretty simple,” he said. Bassist Jackie Fleming admitted that it felt a bit odd adding him to the band on account of the mutual respect and friendship they shared. The actual transition, however, ended up feeling very natural. &#8220;He literally picked up the mic, some crumpled lyrics, and melted in right away,&#8221; Fleming said. Then, Erickson quite eloquently described this period of change from his perspective. &#8220;It was easy,&#8221; he added, &#8220;like I Can&#8217;t Believe it&#8217;s Not Butter.&#8221; (Can you tell that he’s the lyricist?)</p>
<p>Infinite Me spent their hiatus integrating Deano Erickson into the group and working on their self-titled EP. The guys surprised everyone by dropping their <i>Infinite Me</i> on BandCamp for free on February 18th. They then went on to host a solid album release show at The Fallout four days later on the original release date.</p>
<p>This album is unlike anything we have seen from Infinite Me in the past. “The transition itself, the drastic change in sound that we are talking about right now started happening in little ways before Deano joined our band. We moved away from heavy riffs and low-tuned guitars to a more shoegaze, alternative rock kind of sound, with some dramatic effects here and there,” Moores explained. In regards to Infinite Me’s “total new sound,” Erickson said he &#8220;tried to write vocals that weren&#8217;t the focus of the song, but more a part of the emotion that the instruments blend to represent.&#8221;</p>
<p>These five guys are continuously moving and gaining momentum as they go. Moore’s thinks that “the transition was/continues to be a successful one,” and he is “extremely happy with [Infinite Me’s] music right now.” You can catch Infinite Me on April 4th opening for Balance and Composure at The New Direction in Fargo and download the self-titled EP for free on their Bandcamp <a href="http://infiniteme.bandcamp.com/album/infinite-me-ep">here</a>.</p>
<h4>Hippo Campus</h4>
<p>There’s something really special about Saint Paul’s sudden gem of band, Hippo Campus&#8211;and no, it’s not just their age or their precise pop sound as The Current and NME (!) have pointed out. From recently playing The Current’s 10th birthday party, to a song of theirs being featured in a Super Bowl commercial,  Hippo Campus has cultivated an audience that young bands in our scene rarely reach. After their recent sign to prominent indie label Grand Jury, one can only expect more to come from this band.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/bgi5eYrwtmg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>At my school, where some members went and graduated, there’s a sense of cultish pride for this band. Hippo Campus, for my peers, is the success story of our tiny-little-arts-school-that-could. Ask anyone at my school about Hippo Campus and you’ll for sure get a few yelps of excitement. Even our teachers remember the good ol’ days, when the boys from Hippo Campus took the classes that current students do now. It’s almost like they are celebrities at our school, rather than alumni. For a small arts school, that’s huge.</p>
<p>For the wider community and scene, the band is a fresh jolt of change in a place where bands develop under the scrutiny of their fans. When the video for “Little Grace” came out, Hippo Campus had no other songs previously released and yet their sound was fully developed. Like a Vampire Weekend song, “Little Grace” has a rhythm that taps like fingers on a glass window. It immediately draws you in with a sense of unwavering optimism and sound. In a world where artists have so much delicate intention and purpose before they even start with an idea, “Little Grace” is a type of catalyst.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/jV3bIvRGX8w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>It seems like Hippo Campus came out of the gates raring to go and people couldn’t help but pay attention. Their image is well-tailored and there is a lot of purpose to the way the band goes about things. Whether it’s the stage names the members go by or their sound, the band is constantly working to create a specific way they are seen. If this says anything about their work ethic, the band will continue to make heads turn.</p>
<p>Hippo Campus is that fully blossomed band, the one who’s next move you can’t wait to watch. Keep your eyes on those boys, because if you turn your head for even a second, they’ll be out in the world doing something big. And I can bet you they already have.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/4978/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/4978/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=4978&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Garage is remodeling, Station 4 has been closed for almost two years, Jens Den dispersed, The Charlie Siren House has a baby, The Household was vacated, and both The Cherry Pit and The Medusa were busted. It feels like a bleak time for live local music in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>However, if you are looking for a show of your favorite local bands, or if you are trying to find your start in the Minnesota scene, look no further than our beacon of hope in the Como/Dinky Town area of Minneapolis. Still relatively new, The Como Cabana is one of the best places to catch a show right now. The Cabana is an all-ages home venue that bills itself as being drug, alcohol, and drama free.</p>
<p>It all started a year ago when seven guys signed a lease at 1082 16th Ave SE. With the Household members and tenants moving to Missouri, they planned to use this house to fill the Dinky Town house show void left behind. They moved in in September and had their first show 27 days later. For the first few months there had been no official name, until The Slack Shack (accredited to Hunter Slack) stuck. Hunter Slack handled the booking, played guitar in Ridgewood and ReCurrent, and he lived in the house from September until November.</p>
<p>Slack&#8217;s secession in November was &#8220;a miserable experience,&#8221; but before long everything resumed as it had been. The house agreed to continue hosting shows, and even now Hunter directs bands, handles money, runs sound, and basically everything else necessary to put on a concert. But with The Slack Shack&#8217;s utter lack of Slack, yet another name had to be assigned to this little house. With the double entendre of the Como location and a Barry Manilow song, The Como Cabana was born.</p>
<p>My favorite part of The Como Cabana has to be the people themselves. This house always manages a perfect ratio of natives and newcomers. There is nothing more isolating than walking into a show and not recognizing a single face, but if you were to know everyone that would mean the scene has become stagnant. Slack&#8217;s favorite part of booking are the reactions he has received. Locals claim Cabana shows are unparalleled, and touring acts regularly state their jealousy of our scene. &#8220;Just to hear that stuff and watch the scene grow even further in the five or six months the Cabana has been around is just baffling to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always been a top priority for me to make sure everyone is having a good time,&#8221; Slack said, and everyone consistently does. You never really know what to expect from the Cabana (except Remo Drive, always expect Remo Drive). Crowds range from 20 to over 100 entranced fans and have become increasingly rowdy (hanging from pipes, surging at the drum set, breaking the heating system for the entire house…). Slack, as well as the tenants, are pleading showgoers to be more mindful from this point on, lest they be forced to closed down the Cabana. No matter the bill or the insanity of the night, I can not recall a single time that I walked out of that house without an ineffable feeling of contentment.</p>
<p>March is going to be an especially good month for the house. Hunter Slack, Kevan Larson, and The Como Cabana present: Cabana Fest I. This mini-festival was held March 7th and 8th. Hey, Doctor, Moonraker (California) and Township (Wisconsin) opened day one. Minnesota darlings Weathered and Molly&#8217;s Worst Enemy played next, leading up to Free Throw (Tennessee) and Dowsing (Illinois) as the headliners. Day two was led by The Homestretch and The Retakes, followed by ReCurrent and Crüise. Wanderer and Pierre brought the final close to Cabana Fest I.</p>
<p>As far as the future of The Cabana, they plan to continue putting on shows on an almost weekly basis as long as they can. You can find a comprehensive list of March shows below. There is a 4th of July cookout show in the works, and in August we can expect a two- or three-day Cabana Fest II.</p>
<p>From that first show in September, The Como Cabana has been uniting people of all ages. Bands and fans from right here in Minneapolis can play and convene with people from the Midwest and all around the country. Shows here are always a good time; you just can not leave The Cabana disappointed. Please remember, if you plan on attending a show at The Como Cabana: Keep it cool, keep it legal, keep it open (and please don&#8217;t break anything).</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I guess the only closing thing I have is just a thank you to everyone who&#8217;s attended or played shows at The Cabana. When we started doing this I was really worried it was going to be a flop&#8230;So to see people so stoked on shows at The Cabana has been really really cool and we&#8217;re really excited to see what the second half of the year holds for the house!&#8221;</em></p>

With charming looks, catchy songs and dedication to his fans, Beckett is truly great. He began his rise to fame heading the pop punk band The Academy Is&#8230;. The band took off, gaining a reputation as pioneers of emo punk. Befriending bands Fall Out Boy and Panic! At The Disco, The Academy Is&#8230; became a favorite among pop punk listeners. Their spunky sound and Beckett’s raw vocals set the band apart. In 2009 the band split and Beckett set off on a solo career.

<h4>Nowadays it’s hard to come by genuine talent matched with a genuine personality. <a href="http://thewilliambeckettblog.com/">William Beckett</a> happens to possess both. With charming looks, catchy songs and dedication to his fans, Beckett is truly great.</h4>
<h4>He began his rise to fame heading the pop punk band The Academy Is&#8230;. The band took off, gaining a reputation as pioneers of emo punk. Befriending bands Fall Out Boy and Panic! At The Disco, The Academy Is&#8230; became a favorite among pop punk listeners. Their spunky sound and Beckett’s raw vocals set the band apart. In 2009 the band split and Beckett set off on a solo career. With this new branch of his career Beckett tied the familiar themes of loud pop rock, newer themes of raw, singer-songwriter type music, and even a poppier sound with three EPs.</h4>
<h4>These EPs tease fans by giving a slight taste of what Beckett is working on and builds excitement for a full length album. They landed Beckett a record deal with Equal Vision Records in February 2013. With the help of the record label&#8211;and to the delight of fans&#8211;he released his highly anticipated debut solo full-length album in the summer of 2013, <i>Genuine and Counterfeit</i>. The new album tied all the diverse sounds of his three EPs. He melds pop punk and singer songwriter genres together to create a well crafted album critics fall in love with. As <a href="http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=3373741">Ryan Gardner states on Absolutepunk.net</a>; “With <i>Genuine &amp; Counterfeit</i>, Beckett proves yet again – and this time all on his own – that he should be a household name in pop music”.</h4>
<h4>It’s clear William put a great amount of effort into <i>Genuine and Counterfeit</i>. He incorporates personal themes with his song “Just You Wait”, written for his sister, a soft, raw song led with strong a guitar. When introducing this song at shows William describes the troubles his sister faced when struggling with depression and anxiety. He goes on to express that he wishes this song had been written during the time she needed it most. Instead, he says, it’s here now for his fans when they need it most. With touching lyrics, “No one else seems to have it this hard, no one else has to cover these scars”, and the repeated “It gets better girl just you wait,” this song&#8211;like many of Beckett’s&#8211;contains deep, personal lyrics.</h4>
<h4>Along with his many talents Beckett holds a special place in his heart for his fans. He proves himself an amazing artist.</h4>

<h4>How to describe <a href="https://www.facebook.com/setitoffband">Set It Off</a>? Musically they’re in one of those places where genres just can’t give an accurate description. iTunes lists them as “alternative,&#8221; but they hardly sound similar to other music in that genre. Some places classify them as “pop punk” but again, it’s a stretch to say they sound similar to The Wonder Years or The Story So Far.

<h4>Set It Off come from Tampa, Florida and since forming in 2008 the band has made quite a statement in the alternative rock community.</h4>
<h4>Their early music has the raw sound of a band figuring out who they want to be. Their first two releases&#8211;EPs in 2008 and 2009&#8211;showed great potential that caught the attention of Equal Vision Records who signed them in 2011. The band’s sound became much more defined and professionalized. Through Equal Vision, the band re-released their EP <i>Horrible Kids</i> in 2011, a collection of songs about how it feels to be bullied as a young person and the importance of having confidence. With this re-release, the band gained a lot of media attention and praise. These reviews fueled more expansive and exciting tours for the band and opportunities to share the stage with bands like My Chemical Romance, We Came As Romans, and A Day To Remember. Touring so extensively solidified the band’s passion for performing and fed their desire to make more music.</h4>
<h4><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZFvtsxOTFLo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></h4>
<h4>In 2012 Set It Off released their debut full length album, <i>Cinematics</i>. The 12-track album opens with an instrumental hinting at the album&#8217;s theatrical and symphonic qualities. <i>Cinematics </i>has less specific content than <i>Horrible Kids</i> does, letting the focus for the album weigh more heavily upon sound. Songs on the album like “Swan Song” and “Plastic Promises” show maturity and development as Set It Off find their own sound. A mix of expressive vocals, strong guitar pieces, and subtle yet influential orchestral melodies make Set It Off ready to inspire the world. The song  “Dream Catcher” wills the listener to find their passion and follow it no matter what others may think, while “No Control” deals with the tough situations that we all face in life.</h4>
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='940' height='559' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/1q_1LbDHgts?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<h4>Describing Set It Off as a whole is hard to do; friends have described them as a mix of energy and emotion and have compared them to the sound of My Chemical Romance and the theatricality of Panic! At The Disco. One thing’s for sure though: they are captivating in both their records and at live performances. Set It Off supported We Are The In Crowd on their latest US tour, Reunion Tour, which stopped by THE GARAGE in early March. Every member jumped along with the music and gave their all for the entirety of their performance. Singer Cody Carson climbed the speakers then came crashing down to the ground in time with the music, and made sure to hold hands with as many people as he could reach.</h4>
<h4>Luckily, we are due for a return from the band. Headlining with Our Last Night on the Come Alive Tour. You can catch them <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/517038708423181/">at THE GARAGE on July 27th at 5pm</a>.</h4>
<h4>If you liked <i>Cinematics</i>, keep an eye out for new music from Set It Off due to be released sometime later this year.</h4>

<p dir="ltr">Imagine yourself lying in the soft grass of a river bank during a gentle afternoon at the peak of spring. The sun nods in approval as a flock of birds pass above your head. The soft breeze is like the tones of a pan-flute: whistling through your ears as you admire the willow trees dancing along to its happy tune. Every now and then there is a swell in the river while an otter pokes its head out of the water inquisitively before being swept away by the excited current.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/GoldLionSongs">Gold Lion</a>, started in early 2011 by Mariah Mercedes is a power-folk band based out of Shakopee, Minnesota. Much like a spring day, they play and perform their music like the awakening of new life; like a roaring lion: “Gold Lion awoke from his slumber in the spring. The lush, callow grass was faintly glistening from the fresh morning dew. In his low rumbling whisper he sang ever tenderly, &#8220;I&#8217;ll show you where the light is&#8221;. All God&#8217;s creatures joined in harmony to the aria of the earth, and everything was well.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Listening to their latest release, Lucky You, One More for Me, it is evident the members of Gold Lion intend to own up to everything their rather unique genre entails. There are hints of artists like Fleet Foxes or Bon Iver woven throughout their music, with a unique, almost mystical feel brought about by meandering flute and a slow 6/8 time pulse. All of this is covered by Gold Lion’s lead vocalist, Mariah Mercedes with words flowing like a river over a sometimes smooth, sometimes chaotic landscape. For example, “Bones” on their latest release, brings about a sudden intensity as a flute melody is backed by passionate lyrics and percussion, while “Sink/Swim” ushers in a smoother current that lends itself to the genre’s more scenic parts of the river. Each song is primarily guitar-driven, much like Bon Iver’s For Emma Forever Ago, later giving way to drums and tambourine, similar to the songs of Fleet Foxes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The diverse array of instruments in Gold Lion is the most intriguing part of their sound. In addition to Mariah, Gold Lion includes Liz MacDonald on the cello, Jackie Jansen playing banjo and mandolin, Benton Herbel also on guitar and vocals with Ted Tiedemann on bass, and finally Justen Miller tying it all together on the drums. Indeed, Gold Lion’s lineup alone is enough to establish them as a fine folk band&#8211;enough to transport their listeners to the banks of sunny rivers in the height of spring&#8211;but their vehement desire to fill each song with new intensities and rhythms is what pushes them to own their genre.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Anyone looking for a band that takes folk to a new level should give Gold Lion a listen, and perhaps leave their place on the river bank and join the river in its abounding joy like the roar of a lion.</p>

Listening to post-rock is a bit like driving through the mountains: full of twists and turns, peaks and valleys, and the comforting reminder that whatever you may leave behind, there’s no telling what more lies ahead;  all you have to do is wait. Apollos is largely responsible for my journey into the mountains of Post-rock. Their music takes all that is beautiful about the genre, and runs with it, and to be honest, I don’t think the band members even know where their journey will take them. Much like the mountains, Apollos starts their music in the foothills with an idea. This idea is often a simple riff, or ambient noise laid out in a track, often with a hint of a driving rhythm that sets the tone for the rest of the song.

<h4>Listening to post-rock is a bit like driving through the mountains: full of twists and turns, peaks and valleys, and the comforting reminder that whatever you may leave behind, there’s no telling what more lies ahead;  all you have to do is wait. Apollos is largely responsible for my journey into the mountains of Post-rock. Their music takes all that is beautiful about the genre, and runs with it, and to be honest, I don’t think the band members even know where their journey will take them.</h4>
<h4>Much like the mountains, Apollos starts their music in the foothills with an idea. This idea is often a simple riff, or ambient noise laid out in a track, often with a hint of a driving rhythm that sets the tone for the rest of the song. As the idea grows, so do the mountains: you start to climb up, you notice a pressure on your ears as the drums kick to life, the pines rush by as the guitar fills your head, and finally, the sun suddenly peeks over a distant summit and momentarily blinds you, as what started as a simple idea ends in a breathtaking climax. Apollos&#8217; song “Divine Light” is a perfect example of this imagery. Starting off with soft piano and ambient sound bites of the Apollo moon landing, eventually there is a flood of sunlight as the guitar bursts through and the vocals take over.</h4>
<h4>Apollos started in 2011 and currently consists of Seth Bostrom, Nathan Johnson, and Derek Ludgate. Their first single, “Stand and Fight,” was released in January of 2012 and was followed by an EP in July of 2012, with a new EP set to be released on September 10th this year. Throughout each release, Apollos’ instrumentation has always been focused on setting up the vocals and guitar with layered tracks and smaller musical ideas.</h4>
<h4>One of Apollos’ main charms is its pop-punk influences. The vocals and instrumentation around each chorus are reminiscent of bands like Blink 182 and Brand new, but overall their post-rock genre pulls through to create an interesting blend that works incredibly well. Going beyond the sound, Apollos has a clear faith message woven through each song, which emphasizes the frailty of human existence and the awe of an intimate connection with a God who cares about all.</h4>
<h4>I would urge anyone considering getting into post-rock to give Apollos a try. Apollos invites their listeners along on a journey through the mountains, and the best part is, once you reach the top of one mountain, there’s still the promise of plenty more to come.</h4>

		<description><![CDATA[by Sararosa Marah in the Mainsail brings an intensity to music rarely found anywhere else. Not many bands state their genre on Facebook as punk-grass, and there’s a reason for it. It’s a hard genre to do right, but with their punk influenced music played on blue grass instruments, Marah in the Mainsail gets it perfect. Marah and the Mainsail’s strong folk sound is what Mumford and Sons only hopes to achieve with their own music. Mumford gets nowhere close to the perfect, raw aspects of most songs on Marah’s new EP, Devil Weeds and Dour Deeds. This EP is rough like the bark of a tree, while Mumford’s music is on the softer side, like the friendly bark of a dog. “Birddog Butcher” is probably my favorite song off of Devil Weeds and Dour Deeds, while the slightly poppy “Drag You Down” is a close second. “Birddog Butchers” verses are deeply rooted in folk, while the chorus climaxes into a loud punk sound, so it’s the perfect example of how Marah straddles the two worlds.

<p dir="ltr">Marah and the Mainsail’s strong folk sound is what Mumford and Sons only hopes to achieve with their own music. Mumford gets nowhere close to the perfect, raw aspects of most songs on Marah’s new EP, Devil Weeds and Dour Deeds. This EP is rough like the bark of a tree, while Mumford’s music is on the softer side, like the friendly bark of a dog.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Birddog Butcher” is probably my favorite song off of Devil Weeds and Dour Deeds, while the slightly poppy “Drag You Down” is a close second. “Birddog Butchers” verses are deeply rooted in folk, while the chorus climaxes into a loud punk sound, so it’s the perfect example of how Marah straddles the two worlds. On the other side of things, “Drag You Down” differentiates itself from the rest of the album with its bouncy, pop-like rhythms, and more consistent bluegrass sound.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Marah in the Mainsail relates to punk in how their music is layered and presented. The sounds of the formidable drums and banjo riffs during “Birddog Butcher” rub together and create an almost uncomfortable sensation at first. I felt the sudden urge to mosh as the song hit its climax. The way Marah relates to bluegrass and folk is certainly more apparent than its relation to punk. In all of Marah’s songs, the instrumentation is almost all bluegrass. Bluegrass instruments to me, have the most specific sound out of all the instruments out there. When a band plays with banjos and washboards, there is an obvious difference, and Marah in the Mainsail takes that difference into their own hands.</p>
<p>Marah in the Mainsail blends the best aspects of bluegrass and punk music to create an intense, world straddling sound.</p>
