<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I had the opportunity to talk with the drummer of San Diego rock band Pierce The Veil, Mike Fuentes. The band just got back from an Australian tour, and will be going on the road again for their U.S. tour on September 3. Mike and I chatted about ten years of PTV, their “Circles” music video, tour, and learned who is the best actor in Pierce The Veil. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>GMN: How was Australia?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: Australia was awesome. We were out there with Beartooth and Silverstein. It was our first headlining tour in Australia which was awesome. It was just crazy to see so many fans out there. I mean, we played three nights in Melbourne which is pretty crazy for our first headlining tour out there. It’s safe to say that we need to go out there a lot more and I think we will in the future.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: Even though you’ve been a band for ten years now, Pierce The Veil continues to draw in more and more young people. What do you think attracts teenage alternative fans to your band?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: Well a lot of it is the fact that we’re actually a real band and not some thing that came out of nowhere, you know. I think fans are super attracted to the fact that we’re just four kids that came from San Diego, started a band and really wanted to do it and get to the next level, to play in front of as many people as we can. Just a band that focuses on progressing and giving kids a show. Not just going up there and playing ten songs but giving them a real show, putting together a set with a crazy light show, crazy production. It’s just something we’ve always been fans of&#8211;really putting on a show and having kids leave going “Wow, what the hell just happened” other than just playing the songs. We’re really trying to leave them with memories.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: Your next tour is the Made To Destroy Tour, which comes to Minnesota September 13. What are you most looking forward to with that tour?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: I’m stoked to be on tour with Neck Deep and I Prevail, we’ve never toured with them. Those are both bands that I’m into and I think it’s just a great package. I’m excited to play some new songs along with some old ones. We’re doing some cool stuff on this tour. We’re playing an acoustic song that we’ve never played live in the States so that’s gonna be awesome. For our stage set up we’ve got something special for the kids, something we’ve never done before and I think they’re gonna like it.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: What’s your favorite song to play live?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: Ooh, um, well right now since we’ve been trying new songs out live I think one of my favorite ones is still “The Divine Zero.” It’s the first song we released off the new record and for me it’s the most fun because I hear the kids sing it the most. It’s got a cool bridge breakdown-y part that’s fun to play as well. It’s just a non-stop fast rock song.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: I’ve noticed that, from an outsider’s perspective, on </b><b><i>Misadventures </i></b><b>the drum parts seem more complex compared to your previous albums. Was that a conscious decision or did it just kinda happen?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: I think it goes along with a lot of [Frontman Vic Fuentes’s] writing. Vic always writes a lot of super complex, a lot of times complicated parts that we try to connect with. I hear what he’s doing with the guitar and I just try to follow him on the drums the best I can. So whatever he’s writing, I put the drums to cater to whatever he’s doing. I think it just depends on whatever he’s writing at the time and for this record, we spent so long on it, I think it’s just how much time we spent on it and how we wanted these parts to work out and that’s how that happened. I’m super excited about how the drums came out. We’re all about progression so we keep progressing and keep writing as many interesting parts as we can.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: How did you get into playing drums?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: I went to my first punk show when I was like thirteen, and I instantly fell in love with the drums. I just automatically focused in on the drummer and was like “Wow, I wanna do that!” Next thing you know I picked up a drumkit from the local swap meet when I was about fourteen and just taught myself how to play through watching other drummers. I’ve just always been attracted to the sound of the drums, the way you can move behind the drumkit, stuff like that. I mean I’ve never had a lesson I’ve just taught myself how to play so that shows that anyone can do it.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: Did you ever try out any other instruments or was it always just the drums?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: I played a little bit of guitar here and there, little bit of bass, but that’s about it. I’ve kind of just stuck to the drums because I knew I had a niche for that and let the other guys handle the guitars. [laughs]</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: How have you watched the scene evolve in your ten years?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: A lot of the scene has definitely evolved through the internet, I believe. [laughs] You know there’s so many bands coming out of nowhere and they’re all at the tip of our fingers now. Before you just had to go and hand out demos and get your music out there in other ways but now it’s so much easier with social media. It’s becoming a bit of a challenge to start a band I think because there’s so many bands out there and you can listen to them so easily. I think it’s just one of those things, you know, you gotta keep just writing songs and keep touring and keep putting yourself out there if you want to do anything.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: Do you think that in a way, social media has broken down the rockstar mystique? And is that a good thing or a bad thing?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: I haven’t really seen anything change in that realm. There still are those rockstars out there but I don’t think there’s any room for them in our genre because fans want to be respected and they’re human beings who can see right through that. That’s kind of how we look at it&#8211;there’s no room for any rockstars here. We’re just normal people and we want to hang out with the people who listen to our music.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: Do you get starstruck anymore?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: [laughs] Well I was in L.A. the other day and I was walking down the street and I saw these camera guys like, running around and I was like “What the heck?!” I realized it was paparazzi and the guy coming down the sidewalk&#8211;I walked right by him&#8211;it was Sylvester Stallone.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: Woah.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: I was like “Woah that’s kinda cool!” and got a little starstruck for a second. When you see actors that are on that level and who have done so much you kinda can’t help it. Like if you saw like, Leo walking down the street you’d be like “Woah! That’s Leo!” [laughs] You definitely react in a different way.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: I feel like at some point people get so famous that you don’t fully recognize that they live on the same planet as you.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: Exactly, yeah. And, you know, I feel weird if kids feel like that about me…’cause I’m not cool.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: Do you picture yourself doing this for another ten years?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: I mean I sure hope so. I’d like to do it for the rest of my life. No backup plan. Drums ‘till death, is my saying.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: I first saw you live about three years ago when you were on the House Party Tour with A Day To Remember. That was a huge tour at the time. What tours really stand out to you over the years?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: Yeah, I would say the House Party Tour is one of those that stand out to me. Also the Spring Fever Tour that was with All Time Low and a couple tours before that as well where bands like A Day To Remember, like Bring Me The Horizon, All Time Low were taking us out and giving us a chance. ‘Cause you know, they were into our band then and they liked what we were doing so you know, we learned a lot from them and other bands like that just from them taking us out and kinda showing us the ropes and how it’s done really. Now we are in that spot now so we’re able to take other bands out as well and show them some more kids to play for. We just did that with the Misadventures Tour, we took out a small band on (Fearless Records) called Movements and they were super respectful of everything and I think they’re gonna go really far and they were just stoked to be playing in front of that many people and you know, they deserve to.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: Do you think touring is more important than releasing music or the other way around?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: I would say it’s equal. I mean, if you’re touring and you don’t have a record out then there’s no real point, like what are you supporting? You gotta have something for kids to go home with and learn your songs with. Also, you know, if you put out a record and you don’t tour on it then what’s the point of that, too. Fans want to see you perform the stuff live and they want to see it in real person. For me I think it’s 50/50.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: What albums have you been listening to lately?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: A lot of bands have put out new songs and a lot of bands are gonna start releasing records soon. I’m actually pretty stoked about that new Green Day song they put out, it reminds me of their old stuff. I think it’s called “Bang Bang?”</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: Yeah, “Bang Bang.”</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: It’s a great song, it reminds me of their </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Dookie </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">album or something like that. A Day To Remember is releasing some new stuff that sounds pretty cool, back to their punk rock roots it sounds like. My rap side is feeling the new Drake, feeling the new Schoolboy Q, the new YG. I like all kinds of music. The other day I was driving home listening to a jazz playlist and I was just grooving to some jazz. I go all over the map.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: Listening to </b><b><i>Misadventures </i></b><b>all the way through I can hear a lot of different genres being expressed. It’s not all specifically hardcore. What were some inspirations for that album and what were you listening to when you were in the studio?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: I know we were listening to a lot of old punk rock, a lot of fast stuff and that’s the reason why there’s a couple fast songs on there. For a lot of the groovy ones, like, I know Vic was listening to a lot of The Neighbourhood for a while, and the new Weezer and stuff like that. Just a variety of stuff that’s coming out right now&#8211;there’s just a lot of good music out right now and I think it’s a good time for rock music. A lot of bands are coming back, you know, you got Guns N Roses back for the first time in how many years and everyone’s coming out of the woodworks so it’s gonna be a good couple years here for rock.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: About a month ago you released your video for “Circles.” Was that an entire built set? How did that work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: Well the location was a spot in L.A. where they shoot a lot of different music videos so it was like a huge warehouse. It was full of props as well. They set up each scene for each shot. So, we’d be doing a scene at the bar, which they set up, and then while we were doing that scene they set up the live performance scene. They had a crew&#8211;two different crews&#8211;doing both sets so it was seamless so we could shoot the whole thing in one day. But it was still like a seventeen hour day of just non-stop people working. That’s the way to do it, you know, just bang it out in one day and get as many shots as you can.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: Who came up with the idea for the video?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: We based it off an old movie called “Nothing But Trouble.” I think Vic might have come up with that. Yeah, it’s just a cool movie we were into back in the day. If you haven’t seen it you should definitely check it out and you’ll get where we came up with these shots through that movie.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: I know the subject matter for the song itself is pretty dark&#8211;it’s about the Paris attacks back in November.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: Yeah, we wanted to put a little different spin on it because that’s such a tragic event you know, and we wanted to put a more positive spin off the song. In the video, it has happened to us before, where we’ve checked into a hotel and got a super sketchy vibe and we were like “Woah, man, we gotta get out of here.”</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: Who do you think is the best actor in the band?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: [laughs] Well (bassist Jaime Preciado) really gets into it, and kind of overdoes it a little bit. I think (guitarist Tony Perry) is kind of a naturally shy actor. I think Vic is the most theatrical of the group and I think he might take the cake.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: What’s next for Pierce The Veil after the Made To Destroy Tour?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fuentes: Well after that we’re going to the UK and Europe with Letlive and Creeper. So that’s gonna be pretty cool. Right now it’s kind of like, we’re kind of in a crazy spot right now because it’s the first time we’ve had a song go to the radio so all these opportunities are kind of coming up. We’re doing a lot of festival stuff and a lot of acoustic stuff and we haven’t done too much of that in the past. But it’s been really cool going to different radio stations and playing for different people, just a different vibe. So yeah, obviously tour tour tour, get out there as much as we can, and play as many places as we can.</span></p>

<p><em>by <a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/ryan">Ryan Johnson</a></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I first encountered Willy ARQ (Answers Require Questions), Minneapolis based hip-hop artist, in the hallways of my high school, far before I had heard any of his tracks. Years later, after attending shows and buying albums, I had a chance to have an online interview with the climbing artist. Willy discussed what was behind the </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Black Sheep</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> EP, his international performances, and where he aims for the future.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>GMN: You’ve had quite the life so far, could you tell us a little about yourself?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Willy ARQ: I was born in Guinea, West Africa in 1994. I lived in Liberia till I was six years old and moved to the United States in 2000. When my family and I first moved to the U.S we lived in North Minneapolis. I grew up poor without any money&#8211;even in Liberia, as well. There was a time when I would wear the same clothes twice a week. Ever since moving to the United States, I have lived in Minnesota but moved around the Twin Cities. There was a time when I was homeless in high school without any family members around me. Everyone chose to go live their life how they chose, or life’s circumstances took them away from me. I spent my senior year of high school playing football, going to school, and working at Little Ceasars. I began recording music junior year of high school, but I’ve been rapping since I was 12 years old, listening to hip hop since the age of six. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>GMN: You’ve been rapping for a long while. How did you get into rapping, or music in general, at such a young age?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Willy ARQ: The first rap song I ever heard was Little Bow Wow’s “What’s My Name” and ever since then I’ve been hooked. My uncle used to listen to Tupac a lot, Bob Marley, Biggy, and so on. Reggae and hip-hop to me are very closely related. I chose hip-hop because the artists spoke of the world I was living in, the ghettos, poverty, desiring a better life and the whole lifestyle pertained to me even as a little boy. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>GMN: When did you start doing shows or performing in front of others? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Willy ARQ: I started performing in college at open mics, and then at my university. I performed in front of 1000 plus people my second year of college at our school opening show. I’ve performed in Europe in the fall of 2015, Rome, Berlin, Manchester, London, Edinburgh.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>GMN: Your EP </b><b><i>Black Sheep </i></b><b>has some pretty open personal stories, is it tough sharing such personal information in your art? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Willy ARQ: It is tough sharing personal stories and it reminds me of my life so much that it sucks to write about it sometimes. I enjoy writing about my life even though it is tough because the message impacts people greatly. For my next project, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Simple 13’s</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, I am still talking about my life, but making the music more appealing and something people can bounce to while hearing my music. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>GMN: Who are some of the most influential artist for you right now?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Willy ARQ: The most influential artists for me right now are J Cole, Kendrick Lamar, and Dizzy Wright. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>GMN: What new projects can we expect from you, hopefully, in the near future?  </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Willy ARQ: I am releasing a mixtape titled </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Simple 13’s</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> late this summer. The mixtape is based off of my desire to make simple music that people can bounce to and feel free like they once did in high school. This mixtape is mainly aimed toward college students, but it’s for everyone else as well.</span></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/8914/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/8914/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=8914&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>by <a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/sararosa">Sararosa Davies</a></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fraser A. Gorman is often classified by his Americana, Dylan-esque sound despite his Australian home. The distance between our continents doesn’t matter when listening to <em>Slow Gum</em>, his most recent release though. Gorman’s influences, Bob Dylan and Lou Reed, are there in his sound despite the thousands of miles that separate where the three artists come from. With lyrics that are reminiscent of old photographs in their stark, head on beauty, Gorman’s music seems much older than he is at 25. You could place him right next to Dylan in a set and no one would ever know that he is a relatively new artist.  Recently, I sent Fraser a couple questions about the Melbourne scene, his influences, and being part of the community at Courtney Barnett’s Milk! Records. Here are his answers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>GMN:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> If you could describe your sound in three words, what would those words be?</span></p>
<p><b>Fraser A. Gorman</b><span style="font-weight:400;">: Wordy, Groovy, Country-ish (music).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>GMN:</b><span style="font-weight:400;">Your sound seems to reference and reflect those who came before you. One striking comparison in my mind seems to be Bob Dylan or even Lou Reed. Who are three of your biggest influences from the past? What draws you to these artists?</span></p>
<p><b>Fraser A. Gorman:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Lou Reed and Bob Dylan are my two favourite songwriters, so thanks for the nice comparison (Townes Van Zandt is 3rd). I am not entirely sure what draws me to anything. It&#8217;s probably just seemingly fearless lyrical exploration that all of those artists managed to show over their careers. I started listening to those guys when I was 12 or 13 and I often today still get blown away by some of their lines. I often get asked to explain why I like things and it is sometimes difficult to put my finger on exactly why I like it. Maybe I can escape reality through the music that these people made, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a number of things. Music is incredibly powerful, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll agree&#8230;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>GMN:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> If you could collaborate with any artist living or dead, who would it be and what would that collaboration look like?</span></p>
<p><b>Fraser A. Gorman: </b><span style="font-weight:400;">To be honest I feel rather privileged to have been able to collaborate with the musicians I have already worked with, most notable amongst Americans would be Courtney Barnett who is a very close friend of mine, but also Davey Lane from the incredible Australian rocknroll band, You Am I and Dan Luscombe of an equally amazing band, The Drones. I&#8217;d like to meet Cass McCombs one day, he&#8217;s definitely one of my favourite American songwriters and if I ever got to collaborate with him that would be even more amazing. I also have been listening to Kevin Morby a bit lately and I like what he does.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>GMN:</b><span style="font-weight:400;">Your most recent release <em>Slow Gum</em> is so strong in its lyrics, the images are stark and beautiful. What is your songwriting process like? Do you draw from real life influences or more fictional ones?</span></p>
<p><b>Fraser A. Gorman: </b><span style="font-weight:400;">Slow Gum was a record mainly written about my own experiences from my early 20&#8217;s. Some of it was quite emotional and some of it I was more poking fun at myself. I tend to lean more towards darker lyrical content, but I&#8217;m also a fan of keeping the actually music reasonably optimistic. I&#8217;m not a super dark character, I like to have fun and be positive and I hope that shines through somewhat in my music. My songwriting process is predominantly a thing I do on my own. I wrote Slow Gum sitting on the end of my bed in a really shitty share house in the inner city of Melbourne. The ceiling of my room leaked often and it was very dank. Maybe they influenced the sound record a bit or just made me feel perpetually &#8216;sick&#8217; all the time</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>GMN: </b><span style="font-weight:400;">How has your trajectory as a musician changed from when you were younger?</span></p>
<p><b>Fraser A. Gorman: </b><span style="font-weight:400;">When I was young I used to play in a garage rock band called &#8216;Revolver &amp; Sun&#8217; with my friends Stu and Cook from a band called King Gizzard &amp; The Lizard Wizard. We started playing in pubs when we were 15-16 around Melbourne and Geelong and although we were pretty scrappy we had fun. It was probably a good preparation for things that would come later on. My trajectory in music I guess is similar, I just make it because it&#8217;s what I am immersed in completely and haven&#8217;t ever looked back&#8230;. except I guess I have some great management and labels and whatnot so things are a bit more serious. But the love of it is still very much there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>GMN: </b><span style="font-weight:400;">You are signed to Courtney Barnett’s Milk! Records which is such a strong international showcase for Australian music. For those outside of Australia, what are the essential things to know about the scene there?</span></p>
<p><b>Fraser A. Gorman: </b><span style="font-weight:400;">The Australian music scene (in particular, the Melbourne scene) is something that I am quite proud to be apart of as there is so many amazing bands, great indie labels and venues to play at. Especially considering our population  is so small and we are so far away from everything. I could rattle off the names of all the awesome bands that exist around the corner from me right now but I&#8217;d probably be here forever. It&#8217;s really exciting that breakthrough artists like Courtney Barnett,  Tame Impala, and Eddy Current Suppression Ring have sort of opened the gates of the international music community and shined a bigger light on our little scene. Being associated with Courtney has allowed my music to travel a lot further than it may have done  without her so I&#8217;m eternally grateful for support. Plus she&#8217;s a total legend and a really great friend so it makes me so happy to see her killing it all over the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>GMN:</b><span style="font-weight:400;">And lastly, since we are a blog with a focus on covering music from a youth/young adult perspective, if you could tell your younger self one thing about making music/life/art, what would it be?</span></p>
<p><b>Fraser A. Gorman:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> I would just say don&#8217;t worry about what anyone thinks of anything and make music for your own enjoyment and artistic pleasure. And if people dig it then that&#8217;s really cool but if they don&#8217;t dig it that&#8217;s also cool! It&#8217;s something that I often try to tell myself daily. It&#8217;s nice to get accolades and whatever but as long as you are proud of your own work then that&#8217;s all that matters. I&#8217;d also say have heaps of fun with everything you do because as soon as you aren&#8217;t having fun you should really look at yourself&#8230;&#8230; Something like that anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The two members of the alternative-rock band <a href="https://looplinemusic.bandcamp.com/">Loop Line</a> may exist long distance between Minneapolis and Arizona, but that doesn’t keep them from continuing to write and release music. I recently caught up with Paul and Luke over email to discuss making music over the Internet and how to avoid music videos looking like jerky commercials. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>GMN</b><span style="font-weight:400;">: </span><b>Introduce yourselves! Who is who and who plays what? </b></p>
<p><b>Paul: </b><span style="font-weight:400;">Hello, we are Loop Line. We&#8217;re actually just two people, Luke and Paul. We both play guitar and sing, and we collaborate on the rhythm section stuff as well. We haven&#8217;t really played any shows lately, but if we did, it would probably be me on rhythm guitar, Luke on lead guitar, both of us on vocals, and a couple dudes off the street to play drums and bass.</span></p>
<p><b>Luke:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> It&#8217;s just the two of us when we&#8217;re recording, so we wear many hats.  Our roles used to be more defined; I used to write more of the lyrics while Paul wrote more of the arrangements, but I&#8217;d say we have equal input in both those areas now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>GMN: You’re a fairly up and coming band, so how did you get your start? </b></p>
<p><b>Paul:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> We were in a band before this one, and realized that our musical tastes were pretty in line with each other. As more and more music was written for that band, we became writing partners over time. When that band dissolved, we wanted to continue writing music, so we started Loop Line.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>GMN: What’s the creative process like over the Internet versus face to face? Has that been the process with your last two EPs? </b></p>
<p><b>Paul:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Our first LP </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Tides</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> was some of the stuff left over from our previous band, but we also had individually been writing a lot of new stuff. When we sat down and listened to it all, we noticed some things thematically that could be connected. Around that time, Luke moved to Japan, so we took those demos we had and slowly worked on them by emailing files back and forth. We actually did a lot of work via the now-defunct Google Wave. We had all this stuff documented on Google Wave, and then they shut it down, annihilating the documentation of the recording of that LP. Kind of sad. R.I.P Google Wave. For our EP </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Wakes</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, we only had to coordinate four songs, instead of the 21 songs on our LP. It was a much easier process, so we just used email to share notes and files.</span></p>
<p><b>Luke: </b><span style="font-weight:400;">Our process is pretty similar whether we&#8217;re working together in the same room or online. It probably takes longer online, but I think the songs end up in the same place they would if we were working together in the same room.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>GMN: Was there any music from your childhood/teen years that influenced your sound now? Did you play in bands in high school? (if you are older than high school age..) </b></p>
<p><b>Paul:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> I grew up on classic rock mixed with some pop radio, but there were always bands that my mom played that I was especially fond of: The Cars, The Police, The Outfield, R.E.M., among others. As I got older, I still appreciated the older rock, but got into the 90s rock scene of Weezer, Oasis, Smashing Pumpkins, and then got really into the early 2000s rock scene. The Strokes, The Hives, The Vines, White Stripes. After that rock scene cooled down, I took a deep dive into the Beatles and Beach Boys catalogs. That&#8217;s when I was really inspired to start writing my own music. I never really had a band in high school. I was a late bloomer musically. </span></p>
<p><b>Luke: </b><span style="font-weight:400;">I was really into punk in high school, but the energy and attitude of those bands have stuck with me more than the sound. Although sometimes I&#8217;ll randomly listen to a record I was really into in high school and realize that there is a melody or something that I&#8217;ve subconsciously stolen and put into one of our songs. I was in a high school band, but we didn&#8217;t play out much, mostly because there was nowhere for us to play.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>GMN: Your first single off of your new EP </b><b><i>Wakes </i></b><b>is “Parts Unknown,” which you released a video for featuring a camping adventure gone wrong. Where did that idea come from? </b></p>
<p><b>Paul:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> I do some work with a film group, and asked if they&#8217;d like to help us do a music video for the EP. One of the guys said he had this idea for a campsite that gets wrecked by a sasquatchian monster, and I told him we had a song that might actually work with that. We then worked that idea together with the song, and it just kind of fit. We actually didn&#8217;t decide to shoot it like a b-movie until the morning of the shoot, and it&#8217;s a good thing we did. I can&#8217;t imagine what it would have been had we not made it look like a 70s film. Probably would have just looked like a Jacks Link&#8217;s &#8220;Messin&#8217; with Sasquatch&#8221; commercial.</span></p>

<p><b>GMN: Has there been a show that you’ve played that’s been the most memorable so far? </b></p>
<p><b>Paul:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Well&#8230;we&#8217;ve played one show, haha. So technically, it is the most memorable show we&#8217;ve ever played. It was before we had recorded our first LP. We played songs that didn&#8217;t even have lyrics yet, so looking back, it was a very weird thing to do. It was at the Kitty Kat Club in Dinkytown. I think going into some of the songs, I didn&#8217;t even know what I was going to sing. Good thing no one was there! Our old band played at THE GARAGE a few times. Our mic stand might still be back there; I think we forgot it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>GMN: Do you have a go-to favorite local band right now? </b></p>
<p><b>Paul:</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Prince.</span></p>
<p><b>Luke: </b><span style="font-weight:400;">Love Lake released one of my favorite records of the last few years (</span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Beachmaster)</span></i><b><i>. </i></b><span style="font-weight:400;">I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re together any more. We also both love Cesto, which was a band from Rochester, MN that broke up a decade ago. Maybe that reference is a little too local. They should have been huge.</span></p>

<p><em>by <a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/sarahbel">Sarah Bel Kloetzke</a></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">On Friday, April 1 I had the opportunity to sit down with local indie hip-hop duo John Chuck &amp; The Class, consisting of rapper John Chuck “JC” Stroebel and keys/guitar/production/vocals man Henry Donato&#8211;two musicians that have been making music together since middle school. We talked about their sound and live image, personal music tastes, and plans for the future.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN</b><b><i>: </i></b><b>I’ve seen you compared to Chiddy Bang and Twenty One Pilots. How do you feel about these comparisons?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Stroebel: In high school, like early high school, I loved Chiddy Bang and I still appreciate them and like them. They’re like, fun hip-hop and they don’t really ever venture off into a dark sort of vibe, and we also like having happier, lighthearted things that you can laugh about and be comfortable with. So I really like that about Chiddy Bang. And then Twenty One Pilots, I think that a lot of the comparisons are because there are some hip-hop elements in Twenty One Pilots and they’re two white guys as well, doing music. We also get compared to Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, and those are the two white guy duos that we get compared to.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN</b><b><i>: “</i></b><b>Church boy Macklemore?”</b></p>
<p>Stroebel: Yeah, there you go, yeah, church boy Macklemore.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Donato: I think the thing about what we’re trying to do, and about comparisons&#8211;I don’t completely mind them, because I feel like, you know, people are just comparing to whatever other production duo they might see. If one guy’s doing production and one guy’s doing the rapping or singing you’ll be compared. I think what we try to differentiate is our sound. I think that’s what anyone tries to do, is break away from being compared to other sounds. Sound like ourselves! That’s what we want to do.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN</b><b><i>: </i></b><b>Listening to “Business As Usual” I know that it’s hip-hop, but I also get an indie vibe. Is this a representation of your personal music tastes?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Stroebel: A million bajillion percent. I think hip-hop isn’t the main style of music that Henry or I listen to, I’ll let him speak for himself, but I obviously love hip-hop enough to be a part of it and to rap and I do appreciate hip-hop and listen to it often, but I think that I really, I don’t know. I like a good indie song. A good poppy, indie tune that gets stuck in your head. A lot of times rap doesn’t often get stuck in people’s head&#8211;I’m not walking around just reciting Kendrick Lamar lyrics in my head. But like, a catchy tune will always get stuck in your head, so I think that’s kinda why I like having an indie vibe.</span></p>
<p>Donato: Yeah, definitely, you know and I think the indie vibe kinda comes from trying to be unconventional. I think that when we were writing that song and when we write any song we’re trying to look for things that might catch people off guard, or they might feel that it’s kind of unexpected, like “oh I haven’t heard that from hip-hop before” y’know?&#8211; little elements, sounds, lyrics, whatnot, to catch people off guard.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Stroebel: Yeah and I think that, honestly, I would love to be equally called a hip-hop band as we are called an indie band. If people were describing us as an indie band that would be awesome. Because we do put in an effort to have a sound that isn’t like chanty call-and-response choruses&#8211;not that those are bad, but we just want to be different.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN:</b> <b>What are you listening to currently?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Stroebel: I just got this Miles Davis record that I’ve been listening to on repeat, I guess that’s the most current thing that I’ve been listening to. I really like Kendrick Lamar, like I mentioned earlier, as far as hip-hop goes he’s unbelievable. It kind of just then goes off into all of the different bands I listen to. I guess I really do like The Current and a lot of the stuff they play on there. Yeah, I don’t know, nothing like super specific.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Donato: Yeah, I guess a few bands that I know directly influence me and how I look at our music are Vulfpeck&#8211;I listen to them a lot&#8211;and James Blake are a few names&#8211;electronic artists&#8211;and also Vulfpeck being kind of a funk influence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Stroebel: Tuxedo, that inspires me a lot, Mayer Hawthorne, so groovy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Donato: Yeah, that&#8217;s a good list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Stroebel: That is a good list.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN:</b> <b>That is a good list. I saw you open for Time Atlas back in December,</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Stroebel: Yeah, the mic feedback show!</span></p>
<p><b>GMN:</b> <b>You were really entertaining to watch. In your opinion, how important is stage presence?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Stroebel: Well I grew up doing theater and stuff since I was in like first grade, so it&#8217;s just ingrained in me that you gotta work the audience and play to what they want and I think that it kinda transfers into our performances. I mean, every iconic musician out there had their own unique stage presence. Like, if someone&#8217;s moving in a certain way you can be like “Oh they&#8217;re moving like Mick Jagger” or “that looks like a Michael Jackson move” y’know? It&#8217;s iconic more than just the sound, it&#8217;s the visuals of it too.</span></p>
<p>Donato: Yeah, I think ideally when you&#8217;re performing live you should be excited about what you&#8217;re performing and excited about sharing it with people, and that should just come across as you’re confident and you’re experiencing joy, you know? And however that looks on stage is just a part of it, it’s just like your image and what you see online and our music and whatnot goes together.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Stroebel: I think that just body language in general, like if you’re trying to communicate the lyrics in your song, it should match up with kinda how you’re moving. Our lyrics are about, like, dysfunctional white boys and so we’ll totally move like that as much as we can on stage.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN:</b> <b>Move like dysfunctional white boys?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Stroebel: (laughs) Yeah! Exactly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Donato: Yeah, I try to imagine that before every performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Stroebel: Get in the zone just by, zoning in on what that is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Donato: Pretty much.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN:</b> <b>This is the first show of Whosah’s WORK release tour. Have you toured before? What are you most looking forward to with this little tour?</b></p>
<p>Stroebel: I guess tour is&#8230;when you’re in like middle school and high school and you dream about being in a band, when you think “tour” you think like multiple months, flying places, being in a cool van… so like, touring, I guess I have toured if it means going out for like a week or so here or there. I haven’t toured with John Chuck &amp; The Class, I guess we’ve driven to places that are far away and…</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Donato: &#8230;played one show and came back, you know?</span></p>
<p>Stroebel: Is that a tour?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Donato: No</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Stroebel: We were touring Michigan?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Donato: Touring is a loose term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Stroebel: Yeah, I guess the answer would be no. I’ve never done a real tour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Donato: I mean, you toured with a church group and I’ve toured with a couple different artists otherwise but not John Chuck &amp; The Class.</span></p>
<p>Stroebel: This will be the first time we’ve had multiple shows lined up in multiple locations as John Chuck &amp; The Class.</p>
<p><b>GMN:</b> <b>What’s with the signs you hold up at the beginning of your performances?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Stroebel: As you can see, during our performances, unless you count the tambourine, there’s never an instrument in my hand. Our intro is completely instrumental with sampled vocal tracks and stuff, so I’m not really doing anything. I think that it just grew out of me wanting to catch people’s attention. You know, trying to be theatrical but not over-the-top, and to the point where if you’re in a bar where no one came to see you and you’re just the band people will start paying attention just because they’re interested in what you’re doing. I guess it’s just an attention-grabber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Donato: Yeah, I mean, that’ll evolve, we’re doing something different tonight for that, so we’re just trying to grab attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Stroebel: I think Henry and I creatively will just think of something ridiculous and try to execute it and the first thing we thought ridiculous was just like “what if you just throw a bunch of printer paper in the crowd at the beginning of our set?”</span></p>
<p><b>GMN:</b> <b>That’s definitely an attention-grabber.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Stroebel: (laughs) Yeah! I hope no one has gotten a paper cut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Donato: I know! I’m wondering about that. After all these times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Stroebel: Just, in the eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Donato: I’m glad we didn’t get sued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Stroebel: Not yet.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN:</b> <b>I saw that you reached your kickstarter goal! When do you plan to start the work on that EP?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Donato: What’s going on with the EP is we’ve got four songs on it with the intro, “Grow Up,” “Business As Usual,” and “Where Have I Been All This Time?” they’re gonna be on the EP which is being mixed and mastered right now.</span></p>
<p>Stroebel: So we’ve kinda put in the first leg of it already. It’s already written, recorded, and mostly mixed. I guess the next step is working on promotional stuff and designing the CD itself but we wanna have it out by May, I think, if that’s realistic.</p>
<p>Donato: Yeah, that’s the goal. I’m pretty confident.</p>
<p>Stroebel: It’s kind of crazy&#8211;you spend like an entire month focusing so hard on reaching your goal that once you actually do it’s like “Oh, crap! Now we have to actually do what we said we were gonna do!” But it’s a good issue to have, I guess.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Catch John Chuck &amp; The Class on the WORK tour through April 6, and keep an eye out for their debut EP this spring!</span></i></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/8063/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/8063/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=8063&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">On Sunday, April 3rd local pop/rock band Time Atlas will be releasing their new EP </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Obscurity</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8211;a selection of reimagined songs from their debut EP </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Clarity. </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">In the meantime, I’ve been given the opportunity to chat with frontman Grayson DeWolfe about the new batch of music, along with giving the trio of tunes a listen myself.</span></p>
<p><b><em>GMN</em>: When were these tracks recorded?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">DeWolfe: </span></i><i><span style="font-weight:400;">The songs we recorded by ourselves over at (bassist Kristoff Druva’s) studio over the past couple months or so. It&#8217;s been an ongoing project that we&#8217;ve wanted to do for a while but never had the opportunity with so many shows in the fall.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><b><em>GMN</em>: </b>How did you select the tracks you wanted to rework? Personal opinion or fan popularity?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;"><i><span style="font-weight:400;">DeWolfe: </span></i>We chose each track based on potential. We wanted it to be something new for our fans while still having its roots tied to </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">Clarity</span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">. So, if a song presented itself coming in a different way, then we took the idea and flew with it. “Sleepless Nights” was an easy first choice. I had been playing a piano version of (guitarist Josh Bening’s) opening riff for a long time, and we eventually incorporated it into our acoustic set, and now our new EP. The bridge of “Sleepless Nights” gets wild too.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><b><em>GMN</em>: </b>On “Falling”:</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;"><i><span style="font-weight:400;">DeWolfe: </span></i>Back when I was writing “Falling” for the first time I always wanted some string instruments to shine in the pre-chorus and shape the song. In the original song, guitars drive the song forward, but this time around I wrote four string parts for a string quartet. We had them come in and play the music I put in front of them, and I couldn&#8217;t be happier with how it came out. They really drive the song and make it beautifully original, almost like it&#8217;s a brand new song.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><b><em>GMN</em>: </b>So you brought in an actual string quartet?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;"><i><span style="font-weight:400;">DeWolfe: </span></i>Yes! Well, sorta. We had my high school friend Davis come in with cello, and a college friend named Tasha who is an excellent violin player. I wrote two parts each for them, composing with harmonies for their own parts. The cello acted as a mid range voice, and also the bass line of the song.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><b><em>GMN</em>: </b>“Falling”</b> <b>is featuring Chicago band Marina City, want to tell me about that?</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;"><i><span style="font-weight:400;">DeWolfe: </span></i>Yes! We&#8217;ve been super close with that entire band ever since we toured with them in August. Now whenever Marina City comes to Minnesota on tour, they always stay with one of us, even if it means all six of them cramming into an apartment. One night over the winter they were staying with Kristoff and Josh and quickly recorded vocals of “Falling” in Kristoff&#8217;s bedroom before leaving for their next stop. We&#8217;ve got such a close bond with that band, I doubt that this&#8217;ll be the last time we collaborate.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><b><em>GMN</em>: </b>On “Too Late”:</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;"><i><span style="font-weight:400;">DeWolfe: </span></i>“Too Late” honestly almost didn&#8217;t make the cut because I was hesitant on making a stripped down version of a song that was already stripped down a lot. My guitar player Josh insisted though, so I recorded a one take of me playing piano and singing in my bedroom studio and sent it to the guys. A week later it was fully recorded and is a key component to </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">Obscurity</span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">After talking to DeWolfe about the tracks, I gave them a listen myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The first track of the three is one of my favorite Time Atlas songs: “Falling</span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">”</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">Listening to it, I’m immediately graced with the strum of an acoustic guitar before being met with a gentler version of the poppy song. I notice how honest Grayson DeWolfe’s voice sounds, and it’s obvious that his vocals have improved since the initial recording of the track on the </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Clarity </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">EP</span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">The acoustic aspect of the song gives it a drastically different vibe. It sounds intimate, relaxing, and like you’re sitting in front of a fireplace on a chilly day. The sweeping strings of the “quartet” were definitely a good call on the musicians’ part, pulling the track together so it’s definitely not just</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">another typical acoustic song.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The second song chosen to be reworked is “Sleepless Nights.” After seeing Time Atlas live a few times, I’ve gathered that this one is a fan favorite. The beginning of the new version is definitely not what I was expecting-instead of a glittering guitar riff I’m met with an almost melancholy piano part. It’s like it’s a completely new song. There’s a sort of lightness to the original track that isn’t present in this new one, and the song sounds heavy, laced with new meaning. Now, this isn’t a negative thing. I find myself listening to this track more closely, thinking about the lyrics more and really taking in the instrumentals. The bridge of “Sleepless Nights”</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">on </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Clarity </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">is a narration of hope and determination, and practically a battle cry for the dedicated fans of Time Atlas. This aspect of the bridge is very different now, and this aspect of the bridge is now materialized differently*. The song ends strong, with “I will fight until I die!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The last song of the trio is “Too Late,” a simplistic acoustic song I’ve definitely witnessed some people cry to. In order to make this new version minimalistic, the acoustic guitar is replaced with piano, and there aren’t any backing vocals present. This gives a great effect to the song, making it seem more personal, like you’re reading DeWolfe’s journal. The young singer’s vocals are dynamic, drifting from soft words to strong phrases smoothly, his voice filled with power and the aforementioned honesty. It’s a great ending to </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Obscurity</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">. After listening to these tracks a few times and comparing them to </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Clarity</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, I’ve decided that these are definitely new </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">improved, and I very much look forward to seeing how other fans feel about these new versions of the songs on Sunday.</span></p>

<p><em>by <a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/lizzie/">Lizzie Savage</a></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">When a friend first gushed to me about Handsome Ghost, I was a bit dubious. I didn’t think that an English-teacher-turned-musician could write songs that I would connect deeply with, but I fell in love the minute I first listened to the </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Steps</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> EP. Handsome Ghost is an underrated gem in the ambient synth-pop genre, fitting easily alongside bands like The 1975 with their dreamy, melodic instrumentals and singer Tim Noyes’ airy vocals. Preceding the start of their spring tour, I caught up with Tim over the phone to talk about the band’s upcoming tours, indie prom, the Minneapolis music scene, and the film <em>Blue Valentine</em>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How long have you been making music for?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I’ve been making music for awhile now. It’s been about 8 years since I started playing, but Handsome Ghost is just over 2 years old.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What made you decide you wanted to pursue music as a career?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I was actually a teacher in New York City for a couple years right out of college, and I was playing music. I had been playing for fun for a long time, and it started becoming a lot to balance the two. I loved teaching, but it was becoming a real challenge to play a lot of music and put in all the work that’s required to be a good teacher, so I figured it was time to give it a shot. So I started this band up, and it’s been cool, it’s been a good decision so far.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>You released your debut EP </b><b><i>Steps</i></b><b> last year. How has it been received since then, has the response been what you hoped?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Yeah, it’s been great. It’s been really really cool playing the songs live and interacting with fans, and I’ve been really really happy with how people have been connecting with the EP. At this point, I’m really psyched to release some new music, but definitely completely satisfied with the reception to the EP so far.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Your songs combine a lot of very eclectic elements, like acoustic guitar and synth. Was it a deliberate or conscious decision to be creating something so unique, or did it just kind of come together naturally?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Yeah, it was deliberate. I usually start writing songs by acoustic guitar, so that’s where you hear the acoustics. And to me it feels like that, like it feels like someone’s just writing a song in their bedroom, which is usually how it works. But I also really love the more electronic production, so I wanted to give it a shot and to be able to write a song as acoustic, and get to play all the fun tours that I like to play and see if it worked. And it’s been a blast, it’s been really, really fun to make this kind of music. It’s like both of the worlds that I love.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>You’ve identified your sound as “indie prom” (which I love). Elaborate on that, what does that mean?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">(laughing) Yeah, I love it when people ask about that! Indie prom, when we were recording the EP, one of the songs&#8211;we were kind of going back and forth on how we wanted it to sound, and we were experimenting with different tones and different parts, and I was telling the producer that I was working with at the time that I wanted this to sound like a song you would hear at an indie prom. Like an indie-themed prom, you know how you’ve got like 80’s prom, and different themes for these proms, so I don’t know, I’d like to think that our music would play at an indie-themed prom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How much is influenced by your own life, and how much is influenced by other artists, etc?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s mostly just my own life experiences, like mistakes and mishaps and bad times. That’s definitely the influence for the songwriting, like the lyrics and the melodies. [As far as] influences on the sound, there’s not one or two bands that I can point to and be like, “oh this is my favorite band, and this is what I want to sound like”, but I try to take as much as I can from as many different bands as I can. Especially the bands we’ve been touring with, at this point, have been really helpful. It’s been a really good learning experience, seeing their show and listening to their songs and taking little bits and pieces and making our own music better.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>So speaking of bands you’ve toured with, you’re just starting a tour with Great Good Fine Ok. What are you most looking forward to?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It starts on Sunday, I’m excited. I’m really psyched to hear Great Good Fine Ok. I’ve been a fan of theirs for awhile now, so it’s very cool to be touring with them, I’m very excited to see their show. Beyond that, there’s a few cities that I’ve never been to that are part of this tour. It’s always cool to see a lot of those cities, because when you do a tour you often go to a lot of the same cities, so it’ll be fun. We’re going to go check out a few places, and we get to go down to the south for a while where it’s warm which is really nice, because it’s freezing right now in New York. But more than anything I’m really psyched to tour with Great Good Fine Ok. I’m a fan, so it’s gonna be great.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>You’re coming here to Minneapolis, where it’s also freezing cold.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I know, I probably shouldn’t complain actually because Minneapolis is probably way colder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How many times have you played here before?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We’ve played Minneapolis twice before. Once with Borns, who are really cool, good people, good band. And we just played recently with Melanie Martinez, and that was a really fun one too. So 2 for 2 in Minneapolis!. . . .I really like playing there because I feel like the music scene is so good for&#8211;no offense&#8211;but for a city that’s a little bit off the beaten path. It’s really impressive!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>I kind of see it as the center for midwest bands, like obviously there’s Chicago but for anyone farther north than that, this is the place to be!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Yeah, it’s awesome, I feel like it’s not uncommon to hear something cool in the van and be like, “where are these guys from?” and it’s like “Minneapolis again??” It’s cool, it’s really cool.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>So you’re coming here next week, but you also just announced another tour after that as well.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Yeah, we just announced another tour, so we’re gonna be busy pretty much through the entire spring, which is really nice. We get to be on the road and playing songs and playing new songs and all that good stuff. . .It’s gonna be a fun spring, you know, it’s gonna be busy but it’s gonna be really cool. I’m excited for it all to come together.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What are live shows like for you? Is it important to you to remain true to how the record sounds, or do you like to sound different live?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The live show keeps growing, which is really cool. When we started, I would say it was more intimate and a bit more stripped down than you would hear on the record, but I think now overtime I think it’s now maybe even a little bigger than the EP. I mean it’s different. Personally, I would say when I go to a show, I like to hear something a little different than what I like to hear in the car on the way over. So it’s not a huge departure from the EP, but I like to think that there’s enough difference that you feel like you’re witnessing something special for that one night. That’s what we try to do at least!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Since THE GARAGE/<em>Garage Music News</em> is centered around youth and young people, what’s the best piece of advice you got when you were younger that’s still relevant, either musical or otherwise?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">That’s an excellent question. Off the top of my head, as it relates to music, my family and my parents have been unbelievably supportive through this process, and have actually kind of pushed me to follow this passion of mine. So often in music, or in any aspect of your art, you hear stories of like, “go get a real job!”, and I feel like it’s very rare to be around people who are pushing you to pursue what you love. So I think that’s not necessarily one little piece of advice, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">but you know, just go for it, and see what you can do. At the very least you know that you tried. If that makes sense.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Is there anything that you’ve learned over the process that you wish somebody had told you before or that you wish you had known going in?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Yeah, I think the swings in this music are really intense, for lack of a better term. The highs and the lows are really really high, and really really low. I think what I’ve learned that I wish somebody would’ve told me like a couple years ago before I dove in is that it all evens out. When you think you’re on top, there’s a low coming soon, and when you’re at rock bottom you know it’s gonna get better. You just have to keep working and it all makes sense eventually.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Alright, so I’ve just got one last random question for you. . .If you could rewrite the soundtrack to any movie, which one would you pick?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Oh man, okay, that’s a good one. Okay, well I’ll say first that my favorite artist is Elliott Smith, and he was a large part of the soundtrack for the movie <em>Good Will Hunting</em>, which remains one of my favorites. I would say just because I just watched it and I love it, there’s this movie <em>Blue Valentine</em>, with Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. It’s this really, really, really depressing love story. It’s really sad and just so real, and I feel like my music would fit really well with the great great times and terrible terrible times that come with any relationship. I would love to take a shot at scoring that movie.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>I haven’t seen it, but I’ll have to check it out!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If you’re in the mood to get really depressed and never want to be in a relationship ever again, then it’s definitely the film for you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Handsome Ghost will be returning to Minneapolis on March 8th for an 18+ show, and later will be playing at THE GARAGE on Friday, April 22nd with the Summer Set. Be sure to check them out and come to the show(s)!</span></i></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7404/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7404/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=7404&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>by <a href="https://garagemusicnews.com/tag/ryan">Ryan Johnson</a></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Erik Paulson, lead singer of local hit Remo Drive, released an LP last month with his solo acoustic project, Focus Ring. Focus Ring appeared in early 2015 and has been gaining steady traction ever since. Before he opened for the all around amazing Jeff Rosenstock acoustic show at The Garage, I had a chance to sit down with Erik to discuss how this project came along, some details on </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Introduction</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, and where Focus Ring is headed. </span></p>
<p><b>Focus Ring’s first release was early last year, what brought this project on? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I think I was at Chipotle with my friends and I was like “I have a lot of ideas for songs, but they don’t really fit Remo Drive stuff, so I’m gonna try an acoustic thing,” and I then recorded it that night and released it that night. So I did that and was like “this is pretty cool,” so I did another one a month or two later, so I just did a few little EPs like that. Then I kind of lost traction doing it when Remo Drive went on tour for the summer, because I wasn’t home to work on stuff. So when I got home I decided I should try to do an album like this, so I started working on more songs and stuff. I think it was around August that I recorded it, because I had a cold and I didn’t want to go out and do anything. I guess in retrospective it probably wasn’t a good idea to record when I had a cold because my voice sounds kinda off, but I’m still happy with it. I was originally going to put it out in August, but decided to sit on it for awhile, to see if I like it and all that, and now it’s out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Introduction</i></b><b> is your first solo LP and it has so many personal stories on it. Is it a different experience as an artist with having your name attached to this album as an individual? A full album is really exciting as well, how did it feel to complete that? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s definitely a lot different. I get out exactly what I put in, so if something isn’t happening it&#8217;s all on me to do everything, which is kinda a cool thing, but also adds a little more nervousness at shows because you don’t have other people to rely on, but once I got the set really down it started feeling really good because there is some pride in being able to do it 100% by yourself without people there. It’s pretty much like Remo Drive, where I write the majority of the stuff and the other guys add to it, so this is the same, but there aren’t people adding to it. The Remo songs don’t change a whole lot, but you can definitely hear that there is some Austin and Steven playing and in this it’s just all me. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>So, Remo Drive, you guys have been playing lots of gigs, toured with Weathered and some other great bands in early January, and dropped </b><b><i>Introduction </i></b><b>a few days after wrapping up that tour. Does it get tough, working on both? How do you keep those balanced?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I was going to wait a little longer to release </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Introduction </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">after the tour, but I decided might as well. I had been listening to a lot of hip-hop and noticed that Drake and Kanye don’t have huge rollouts before they release stuff, they just put it out there, there&#8217;s not a lot of stuff coming before it. I thought that might be something worth trying and I feel that it definitely paid off. I think it was pretty well received, It seemed that people liked it a lot. It got a lot of downloads on the first day, which is always a nice feeling. Bandcamp has a limit of 200 free downloads a month, so my goal is always to drain those if possible, and I think this got really close like 10 left or actually got them all, so that was exciting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>You obviously have a good amount of songwriting experience, hence the whole album, has that always been more of an independent gig for you, or have you done a lot of writing with Remo?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Yeah, It’s definitely more collaborative now than it used to be. When it was first starting I’d write a whole song by myself and that’d kinda be how it turned out. With some exceptions&#8211;Steven has written a few of them. With the new stuff we’re working on right now especially, it’s a lot more input from everybody else. I didn’t realize before, but kind of letting go of my ideas and letting other people touch them is a good thing. Since we’re all from slightly different musical backgrounds so it’s cool to hear how everybody adds their own thing, I feel like it makes us more unique as a result, rather than me isolated just sounds like me vomiting up all my influences.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Were there any highs and/or lows that really stuck with you throughout the production and release of </b><b><i>Introduction</i></b><b>?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Not really, because it was so much on a whim. I wasn’t really thinking about it a whole lot. The only thing I was kinda conscious about while I was doing it was, the other acoustic releases had been done more hastily, so for this one I wanted it to sound a little tighter performance-wise. So I took a couple more extra takes on stuff then I would have, where with the original stuff, my rule was one take, get it down and good enough. So for each of the songs I just took a week in my room and practiced, then recorded them. I was originally going to release it in September, my friend was going to do tapes for it, but that ended up falling through. By the time December rolled around I contemplated just releasing it, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to wait for someone to release it. So I showed it to my friend Dayton a few weeks before I put it out and he was into it, so we put it out on his little label that he is starting up, which is really cool, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tilderecords/">Tilde Records</a>. They’re also putting out an Infinite Me/Awe Howler split. I’m not sure what is all announced and what isn’t, but it’s cool, check out the label.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What is to be expected for Focus Ring in the future?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I’ve got some guys playing with me now, and I’m a big Weezer nerd, so we play kinda old Weezer-y sounding stuff with a little more influence from outside stuff, it’s not a carbon copy, it just feels like the same kind of energy. Probably an EP of that type of music and another LP of acoustic stuff later in the year, once I have some time to just sit down and get real sad. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>So it’s not exactly a solo project anymore? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s still where I’m planning on holding onto the songs in the same way as I have. They’re just more, like, facilitating me doing what I hear, rather than adding their own stuff. They&#8217;re more like an extension of me, or that’s how it is right now, I’m not sure how it will develop. For now it’s just a similar thing, they’re just my dudes, Eric 2 &amp; Eric 3. </span></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7306/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/7306/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=7306&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><b>GMN: So, to start, why the name Public, and what&#8217;s with the dots?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">PUBLIC feels like a big word because it means everyone. We liked that, so we went with it. The dots identify PUBLIC&#8217;s family. The meaning of the dots is something special. We plan on talking more about that soon.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: How did you guys meet/become a band?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Ben and John were exploring an uncharted island in the Caribbean, when they stumbled upon a village of only bass-players. They communicated only by playing bass-riffs at each other. We saw promise in a young funk bassist named &#8220;Matt&#8221; and brought him back with us. Things worked out pretty well, though he misses his family from time-to-time.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: How does being unsigned influence the music you make?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Everything we do is unsigned. From the clothes we wear to the gas we put in our cars, we are undeniably unsigned. So naturally, our music is an unfiltered dose of expression straight from our hearts to yours. We make the music we truly believe in.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: On Twitter, you guys are </b><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/yourfavoriteunsignedband"><b>#yourfavoriteunsignedband</b></a><b>. Who would you say is yours?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We have some lovely unsigned friends here in Cincinnati. </span><a href="http://jane-decker.com/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Jane Decker</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> is fantastic. </span><a href="http://automagikmusic.com/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Automagik</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> is super groovy.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: Despite being unsigned and small, you&#8217;ve opened for a lot of big names: Twenty One Pilots, WALK THE MOON, MisterWives. Who has been your favorite to tour with so far? (And you can&#8217;t just say all of them.)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">WALK THE MOON was our very first tour, and they were just fabulous. Their fans are ridiculously supportive and we are eternally grateful for that opportunity.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: You guys are heading out on the Trendsetter Tour soon, which is based on votes that you seem to have won by a landslide. What&#8217;s it like having such a dedicated fanbase?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The Dot Tribe is a super loving bunch. They&#8217;ve taken care of us from the beginning, and we can&#8217;t thank them enough. Literally they are the greatest. </span></p>
<p><b>GMN: What do you think will be different from the other tours you&#8217;ve been on?​</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">On this tour, we are the headlining act. It&#8217;s a big deal for us and we are so excited to get going.</span></p>
<p><b>GMN: Aside from this tour, what&#8217;s next for Public?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We have a lot of new material that we can&#8217;t wait to share with you. Hopefully that time comes soon, just getting our ducks in a row. Incidentally, we are also raising a small family of ducks in a nearby neighborhood pool. Most days we just sit around the pool and feed them different breads, seeing which ones they like best. Thank you very much.</span></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/6820/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/6820/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=6820&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Kyle Featherstone, the pianist and electric guitarist of the Eau Claire, Wisconsin-based band The Millenium, has been in the Midwest scene for years. He started performing music in front of people in 8th grade when he performed at a talent show for his school with his band Cold Fusion (AKA Aibohphobia) that broke sophomore year. After that he started to get more into playing with just an acoustic guitar and the same time got into musical theatre and doing stage shows. That fostered his interest in playing on stage. He didn’t play his next real show until college when he began writing more music for a project which became The Picture Perfect in 2011. When The Picture Perfect ended in 2014, The Millenium was already formed with two, Matt Hasenmueller and Kyle Culver. Kyle Joined the band doing backing vocals, piano, and electric guitar. Since The Millenuim has been together they have toured and Kyle has had more dreams come true than he ever imagined possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: When did music become a part of your soul?</strong></p>
<p>A: I would say it really hit me after high school when I really got connected with music and experiencing bands and concerts. It connects with you at the right time and place in your life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: When did music start helping you shape your future?</strong></p>
<p>A: As soon as I started writing what would become the first batch of TPP songs and they started to turn out decent I had a thought of &#8220;wow maybe this could be something&#8221;. From there the idea was incepted and I never looked back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: Did personal friends start changing as the band started to get bigger?</strong></p>
<p>A: Being in a band with friends is hard. They&#8217;re business partners while at the same time best friends and brothers. As with most things in life, difficulties will either bring you closer or farther apart. And that definitely happened with me and my friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are your thoughts on all the fan bases you have acquired?</strong></p>
<p>A: Our fans are the best. They&#8217;re loyal and compassionate and selfless. They have spoiled me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: I know how important it is to be true to the person you love. What goes through your head when women throw themselves at you?</strong></p>
<p>A: Honestly I don&#8217;t have that many women that are all over me. Usually it&#8217;s other guys in the band (or they&#8217;re just not obvious about it to me). I&#8217;ve never been a big ladies guy so I never know how to handle anyone that is way into me haha.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: When did you find people who have the same dreams you have?</strong></p>
<p>A: I actually seldom feel like I find people that identically align with my dreams and ideals and mind set. Sometimes they&#8217;re similarities like with other musicians that want to be on stage, but we&#8217;re never like 100% identical. It&#8217;s strange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is it like when you and the other members don’t agree on the music you’re creating? </strong></p>
<p>A: It&#8217;s hard. You take it personally. Your musical ideals are your babies. They&#8217;re a snapshot of your soul, and when someone doesn&#8217;t seem into it it can be emotionally taxing. Writing music with other people takes a lot of patience, cooperation, learning, and sacrifice from all parties involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: What does the future of The Millenium look like?</strong></p>
<p>A: Lots of writing new songs and hopefully getting back on the road again!</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/6807/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/garagemusicnews.wordpress.com/6807/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=garagemusicnews.com&#038;blog=41126346&#038;post=6807&#038;subd=garagemusicnews&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
